abstract={Over the past decade the theoretical description of surface reactions has undergone a radical development. Advances in density functional theory mean it is now possible to describe catalytic reactions at surfaces with the detail and accuracy required for computational results to compare favourably with experiments. Theoretical methods can be used to describe surface chemical reactions in detail and to understand variations in catalytic activity from one catalyst to another. Here, we review the first steps towards using computational methods to design new catalysts. Examples include screening for catalysts with increased activity and catalysts with improved selectivity. We discuss how, in the future, such methods may be used to engineer the electronic structure of the active surface by changing its composition and structure.},

Despite excellent prospects, voltage fade has prevented effective use of the excess capacity, and a major challenge has been a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the voltage fade. Here, using operando three-dimensional Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, we directly observe the nucleation of a mobile dislocation network in LRLO nanoparticles. The dislocations form more readily in LRLO as compared with a classical layered oxide, suggesting a link between the defects and voltage fade. We show microscopically how the formation of partial dislocations contributes to the voltage fade. The insights allow us to design and demonstrate an effective method to recover the original high-voltage functionality. Our findings reveal that the voltage fade in LRLO is reversible and call for new paradigms for improved design of oxygen-redox active materials.},

abstract = {Expressions relating the roughness of a plane surface to its specular reflectance at normal incidence are presented and are verified experimentally. The expressions are valid for the case when the root mean square surface roughness is small compared to the wavelength of light. If light of a sufficiently long wavelength is used, the decrease in measured specular reflectance due to surface roughness is a function only of the root mean square height of the surface irregularities. Long-wavelength specular reflectance measurements thus provide a simple and sensitive method for accurate measurement of surface finish. This method is particularly useful for surface finishes too fine to be measured accurately by conventional tracing instruments. Surface roughness must also be considered in precise optical measurements. For example, a non-negligible systematic error in specular reflectance measurements will be made even if the root mean square surface roughness is less than 0.01 wavelength. The roughness of even optically polished surfaces may thus be important for measurements in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.},

abstract = {In recent years, the field of catalysis has experienced an astonishing transformation, driven in part by more demanding environmental standards and critical societal and industrial needs such as the search for alternative energy sources. Thanks to the advent of nanotechnology, major steps have been made towards the rational design of novel catalysts. Striking new catalytic properties, including greatly enhanced reactivities and selectivities, have been reported for nanoparticle (NP) catalysts as compared to their bulk counterparts. However, in order to harness the power of these nanocatalysts, a detailed understanding of the origin of their enhanced performance is needed. The present review focuses on the role of the NP size and shape on chemisorption and catalytic performance. Since homogeneity in NP size and shape is a prerequisite for the understanding of structure–reactivity correlations, we first review different synthesis methods that result in narrow NP size distributions and shape controlled NPs. Next, size-dependent phenomena which influence the chemical reactivity of NPs, including quantum size-effects and the presence of under-coordinated surface atoms are examined. The effect of the NP shape on catalytic performance is discussed and explained based on the existence of different atomic structures on the NP surface with distinct chemisorption properties. The influence of additional factors, such as the oxidation state of the NPs and NP–support interactions, is also considered in the frame of the size- and shape-dependency that these phenomena present. Ultimately, our review highlights the importance of achieving a systematic understanding of the factors that control the activity and selectivity of a catalyst in order to avoid trial and error methods in the rational design of the new generation of nanocatalysts with properties tunable at the atomic level.}

Despite recent progress in imaging defects using electron and X-ray techniques, in situ three-dimensional imaging of defect dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use Bragg coherent diffractive imaging to image defects during the hydriding phase transformation of palladium nanocrystals. During constant-pressure experiments we observe that the phase transformation begins after dislocation nucleation close to the phase boundary in particles larger than 300{\thinspace}nm. The three-dimensional phase morphology suggests that the hydrogen-rich phase is more similar to a spherical cap on the hydrogen-poor phase than to the core--shell model commonly assumed. We substantiate this using three-dimensional phase field modelling, demonstrating how phase morphology affects the critical size for dislocation nucleation. Our results reveal how particle size and phase morphology affects transformations in the PdH system.},

Yoshida et al. (p. 317) used an aberration-corrected, environmental transmission electron microscope to follow the changes in both ceria-supported gold nanoparticles and the adsorbed species for this reaction. Electron microscopy reveals how adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules restructure the surface of gold nanoparticles. Understanding how molecules can restructure the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions requires methods that can visualize atoms in real space and time. We applied a newly developed aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy to show that adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO) molecules caused the {100} facets of a gold nanoparticle to reconstruct during CO oxidation at room temperature. The CO molecules adsorbed at the on-top sites of gold atoms in the reconstructed surface, and the energetic favorability of this reconstructed structure was confirmed by ab initio calculations and image simulations. This atomic-scale visualizing method can be applied to help elucidate reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis.}

For example, power-to-chemical processes require a shift from steady-state operation towards operation under dynamic reaction conditions. This brings along a number of demands for the design of both catalysts and reactors, because it is well-known that the structure of catalysts is very dynamic. However, in-depth studies of catalysts and catalytic reactors under such transient conditions have only started recently. This requires studies and advances in the fields of 1)operando spectroscopy including time-resolved methods, 2)theory with predictive quality, 3)kinetic modelling, 4)design of catalysts by appropriate preparation concepts, and 5)novel/modular reactor designs. An intensive exchange between these scientific disciplines will enable a substantial gain of fundamental knowledge which is urgently required.

This chapter examines how atoms are arranged in main engineering solids. Many engineering materials (almost all metals and ceramics, for instance) are made up entirely of small crystals or grains in which atoms are packed in regular, repeating, three-dimensional patterns; the grains are stuck together meeting at grain boundaries. This chapter focuses on the individual crystals that can be best understood by thinking of the atoms as hard spheres. The chapter also discusses close-packed structures and crystal energies followed by crystallography, plane indices, and direction indices. The chapter concludes with a discussion of atom packing in polymers, atom packing in inorganic glasses, and the density of solids.}

The adsorption on Pt(111) at 100–150 K was purely molecular (ice formation) in agreement with previous work. No dissociation of this adsorbed H$_2$O was noted on heating to higher temperatures. On the other hand, adsorption of H$_2$O on Pt(111) + K leads to dissociation and to the formation of OH species which were characterized by a work function increase, an O 1s binding energy of 530.9 eV and UPS peaks at 4.7 and 8.7 eV below the Fermi level. The amount of OH formed was proportional to the K coverage for θK > 0.06 whereas no OH could be detected for θ⩽ 0.06. Dissociation of H$_2$O occurred already at T = 100 K, with a sequential appearance of O 1s peaks at 531 and 533 eV representing OH and adsorbed H$_2$O, respectively. At room temperature and above only the OH species was observed. Annealing of the surface covered with coadsorbed K/OH indicated the high stability of this OH species which could be detected spectroscopically up to 570 K. The adsorption energy of H$_2$O coadsorbed with K and OH on Pt(111) is increased relative to that of H$_2$O on Pt. The work function due to this adsorbed H$_2$O increases whereas it decreases for H$_2$O on Pt(111). The energy shifts of valence and O1s core levels of H$_2$O on Pt + K as deduced from a comparison of gas phase and adsorbate spectra are 2.8–4.2 eV compared to ≈ 1.3–2.3 eV for H$_2$O on Pt (111). This increased relaxation energy shift suggests a charge transfer screening process for H$_2$O on Pt + K possibly involving the unoccupied 4a1 orbital of H$_2$O. The occurrence of this mode of screening would be consistent with the higher adsorption energy of H$_2$O on Pt + K and with its high propensity to dissociate into OH and H.}

abstract = {The adsorption of thermally cracked atomic oxygen on the Pt(111) surface has been investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), co-axial impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). High concentrations of atomic oxygen (∼2×1015 atomscm-2) can be cleanly adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface at room temperature by dosing the surface with externally generated atomic oxygen at relatively low exposures (∼50 L). Two states of oxygen are readily resolved by XPS with O1s binding energies at 530.8 and 530.2 eV. These states are assigned to chemisorbed oxygen and to an oxidic oxygen state, respectively. XPS spectra of the Pt4f region confirm the existence of an oxide species with the appearance of a peak at 2.4 eV higher binding energy than the bulk Pt 4f5/2 peak. Using a combination of angle-resolved XPS, CAICISS, and LEED, evidence is provided to suggest that penetration of oxygen into the surface occurs most likely by an exchange mechanism resulting in the reconstruction of the Pt atoms in the first two atomic layers. On annealing the oxygen covered surface at 500 °C the oxidic layer is observed to decompose and a p(2×2)-O reconstruction is observed. A CAICISS study of this reconstructed surface presents evidence in favour of O atoms occupying h.c.p. sites over f.c.c. sites. Low exposures (∼5 L) of atomic oxygen result in a sharp p(2×2) reconstruction of the Pt(111) surface and a single species in the O1s spectrum at a binding energy of 530.8 eV. Both the p(2×2)-O overlayer and the oxide species are shown to be extremely sensitive to the electron and ion beam.}

abstract = {The oxidation of Pt(111) by gas-phase oxygen atoms was investigated in ultrahigh vacuum using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (ELS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). Atomic oxygen coverages as high as 2.9ML (monolayers) could be generated on Pt(111) using an atomic oxygen beam, and both the adsorption of oxygen atoms and the progression of surface oxygen phases with increasing atomic oxygen coverage are found to be relatively insensitive to the surface temperature over the range from 250 to 450K. The results show that oxidation involves the development of a chemisorbed layer for oxygen coverages up to about 0.75ML, and that the average binding energy of an oxygen atom chemisorbed on Pt(111) decreases significantly (∼100kJ/mol) with increasing oxygen coverage, in agreement with previous observations [D.H. Parker, M.E. Bartram, B.E. Koel, Surf. Sci. 217 (1989) 489, N.A. Saliba, Y.-L. Tsai, C. Panja, B.E. Koel, Surf. Sci. 419 (1999) 79]. Long-range order in the chemisorbed layer generally diminishes as the oxygen coverage increases above the 0.25ML saturation coverage of the p(2×2) layer, though the persistence of a (2×2) LEED pattern up to about 0.50ML is consistent with the formation of domains of a new, high-density ordered phase. Disordering within the chemisorbed layer becomes more pronounced with continued atomic oxygen adsorption to coverages greater than 0.50ML. Distinct features in the O$_2$ thermal desorption traces at 650K and 560K are attributed to the desorption of oxygen from a high-density ordered phase and disordered domains, respectively, which suggests that the binding energy is lowest for oxygen atoms chemisorbed in the disordered domains. Increasing the atomic oxygen coverage above approximately 0.75ML is shown to result in the growth of Pt oxide particles and disordering of the Pt surface. Decomposition of the Pt oxide particles produces explosive desorption of O$_2$ that is characterized by a shift of the desorption peak to higher temperature and a dramatic increase in the maximum desorption rate with increasing oxygen coverage. The main characteristics of the explosive desorption are well reproduced by a kinetic model in which oxygen atoms are assumed to migrate from oxide domains onto regions of the surface containing chemisorbed oxygen atoms, and with oxygen atoms desorbing only from the chemisorbed layer. The implication of this mechanism is that Pt oxide is more thermodynamically favorable than high concentrations of chemisorbed oxygen atoms on Pt(111), and hence that the growth of Pt oxide on Pt(111) is kinetically limited.}

Large oxygen concentrations up to ΘO=2.4ML were produced by ozone exposure on Pt(111) at 300K and analyzed using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). O$_2$ desorption occurs in broad TPD peaks that shift from 814 to 558K as the oxygen coverage increases from 0.03 to 0.95ML. For coverages of ΘO≥1.2ML, “undercutting” of the desorption curves occurs, along with a narrowing and shift to higher temperature, such that O$_2$ desorption occurs in a sharp (23K wide) peak at 708K at ΘO=2.4ML. LEED shows a (2×2) pattern for ΘO near 0.25ML, but then only a (1×1) pattern between 0.3 and 1.2ML. For oxygen coverages larger than 1.2ML, the Pt(111) surface is disordered. Using the leading edge method, we estimate that the desorption activation energy decreases from 45 to 20kcalmol-1 with increased oxygen concentration for 0<ΘO<1.2ML, and thereafter increases with increasing concentration to 38kcalmol-1 at ΘO=2.4ML. We interpret the O$_2$ desorption curves for ΘO>1.2ML as arising from decomposition of particles of platinum oxide of increasing size near the surface. A very weakly bound state of oxygen also exists at high ΘO and desorbs at 390K. Oxidized platinum is reduced upon heating to Pt metal in the temperature range of 674–708K in UHV.}

Raman spectra of $\alpha$‐PtO$_2$ films show two sharp lines at 514 and 560 cm-1, in agreement with those from commercially available powders.

Estimates from XRD line broadening and HRSEM photographs indicate mean crystallite sizes on the order of 300 Å. Infrared reflectivity spectra yield two of the three ir‐active phonons, and along with scanning tunneling microscopy measurements suggest that PtO is a semiconductor.

The instrument facilitates studies of the near-surface chemical composition, electronic and geometric structure of a variety of samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in the photon energy range from 170eV to 2800eV.

By operating the optical elements in a low-pressure oxygen atmosphere, carbon contamination can be almost completely eliminated, which makes the beamline particularly suitable for carbon {\it K}-edge NEXAFS. The endstation can be operated at pressures up to 100mbar, whereby XPS can be routinely performed up to 30mbar. A selection of typical data demonstrates the capability of the instrument to analyse details of the surface composition of solid samples under ambient-pressure conditions using XPS and NEXAFS. In addition, it offers a convenient way of analysing the gas phase through X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Short XPS spectra can be measured at a time scale of tens of seconds. The shortest data acquisition times for NEXAFS are around 0.5s per data point.},

(i) For a clean surface, the results were obtained by employing the standard restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS) model with surface diffusion occurring via jumps to nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor sites. The kinetics of surface roughening at T\\&gt;TR and of surface relaxation at T\\&lt;TR are found to be logarithmic in time. In particular, the mean-square height difference at T\\&gt;TR increases with time as w2∝ln t. (ii) Complementing the RSOS model by terms describing adsorption, we demonstrate that adsorbate-induced surface roughening may occur with significant lowering of TR, due, respectively, to indirect next-nearest-neighbor adsorbate–substrate repulsion, attractive nearest- neighbor adsorbate–substrate lateral interaction, and/or repulsive adsorbate-adsorbate lateral interaction. In all these cases, the ratio of TRnear adsorbate saturation and for the clean surface, respectively, is given by an analytical expression that is a simple combination of the corresponding interactions. The coverage dependence of TR in MC simulations is nonlinear and slightly different compared to the mean-field-type prediction. (iii) The effect of adsorbate-induced roughening on a catalytic reaction can be dramatic even at weak roughening, with qualitative and quantitative changes in the kinetics. For example, the absolute conversion rate at maximum rate, and the reactant mixture corresponding to this maximum can be very different on the flat and roughened surface. The behavior of the adsorbate coverages near the points corresponding to the kinetic phase transitions can change character qualitatively.}",

Basic relations for sputtering of adsorbed layers by ion bombardment and the corresponding cross sections are discussed in the introductory part. The following section presents models for the sputtering of overlayers with the intention of understanding the relevant physical processes and to obtain quantitative estimates. Subsequently, undesirable by-products of ion bombardment, such as surface damage, particle implantation and preferential sputtering are considered. A concise experimental section deals with ion beam and glow discharge techniques applied for surface cleaning as well as with some surface analytical methods (Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy ion scattering, secondary ion mass spectroscopy) which are useful and necessary to check the obtained cleaning effect. In the final section various examples are given and some conclusions are drawn for the efficiency of surface cleaning by sputtering.},

The paper consists of four parts. In the first part, mainly references to various ammonia production technologies are given. Energy consumption, emissions and saving potentials are discussed in the second part. Thereby, the situation in Europe, the US and India is highlighted and various data sources are compared. In the third part of the paper, a novel approach for modeling energy efficiency improvements is described that accounts for uncertainties and unobserved heterogeneity in the production processes. Besides new investments, revamping investments are also included in the modeling and the development of the production stock is accounted for. Finally, in the fourth part, this approach is applied to the modeling of energy efficiency improvements and CO2 emission reductions in ammonia production. Thereby, considerable improvements in specific energy use and CO2 emissions are found in the reference scenario, yet under the assumption of high oil and gas prices, a partial switch to coal based technologies is expected which lowers notably the CO2 efficiency. Introduction of a CO2 penalty under a certificate trading or other regime is on contrary found to foster energy efficiency and the use of low carbon technologies.}

@article{Ma2019,
abstract = {Ammonia oxidation is operated at different temperatures over Pt catalysts of different structures to recover different products. In this work, we elucidate the dependency of ammonia oxidation rates and selectivities on both Pt structure and temperature. We perform density functional theory (DFT) computations to compare the reaction and activation energies of elementary reactions on Pt(211) and Pt(111). We develop a microkinetic model parametrized with the DFT results. We show that barriers to product formation are lower on stepped Pt than on terrace, leading to a much higher step rate at low temperature to selectively oxidize ammonia to nitrogen. At high temperature, however, both step and terrace perform comparably in rate to selectively produce nitric oxide. While N 2 is always the thermodynamic product, relative N and O coverages interact to make NO the kinetic product at high temperature. The predicted rate and selectivity are consistent with experiments. We further show rate-controlling steps on the two Pt surfaces are different at low temperature but are the same at high temperature. The degrees of selectivity control for elementary reactions are comparable for the two surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the flows of elementary reactions in the reaction network are also structure- and temperature-dependent.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.}

Such species show high stability against thermal or H$_2$ treatment probably due to the presence of a substantial amount of chlorine on the surface. Treatment of the samples prepared from Pt(NO3)4 with H$_2$ leads to the formation of metallic Pt nanoparticles accompanied by the improvement of catalytic activity in NH$_3$ oxidation at T<200 °C. The main products of ammonia oxidation at temperatures below 250 °C were molecular nitrogen and nitrous oxide with the N$_2$ selectivity reaching 80 \%.

It was found that the addition of non-stoichiometric metal oxides to Pt/USY leads to the generation of additional acid sites for ammonia chemisorption and that N$_2$ selectivity improved with increased strong acidity of the bi-functional catalysts. The oxidation state of active Pt could be adjusted by the introduction of non-stoichiometric metal oxides with increased concentrations of oxidized Ptδ+ species observed in the order of FeOx >CeO2-x >MnO2-x >Pr6O11. High valence platinum surrounded by atomic oxygen that can act as a proton scavenger to drive ammonia activation, inhibiting O$_2$ dissociation and therefore improve N$_2$ selectivity.

Molecular NH$_3$ desorbed from Pt(410) between 100 and 450 K, and dissociation was not observed. Radiation (X-rays, electrons) induced NH3ad dissociation, and as a result several dissociation products (NH2ad, NHad, and Nad) were observed in the N 1s core-level spectrum. NHad is a rather stable dissociation product that starts to dehydrogenate above 350 K. The Nad and Had formed in this process desorbed on formation (as N$_2$ and H$_2$). Both molecular and dissociative O$_2$ adsorption were observed after the surface was exposed to O$_2$(g) at 100 K. Molecularly adsorbed O$_2$ desorbed below 200 K, whereas atomic oxygen desorbed (as O$_2$) between 600 and 900 K, in two distinct desorption peaks. In the O 1s core-level spectrum, both molecular O$_2$ and two different types of Oad were distinguished. NH3ad dissociation was observed on an oxygen-presaturated surface. The NH3ad oxy-dehydrogenation started at 150 K. NOad and NO(g) were also observed, but only during experiments in which an excess of Oad was available. NOad desorbed/decomposed between 400 and 500 K. For the steady-state ammonia oxidation reaction, N$_2$ and H$_2$O were the major products at low temperatures, whereas the selectivity toward NO and H$_2$O changed at higher temperatures. This selectivity change can be attributed to changes in surface composition.}

Based on a mechanism of ammonia activation via the interaction with Oad/OHad a detailed and a simplified mathematical model were formulated which reproduced the experimental data semiquantitatively. From transient experiments in vacuum performed in a transient analysis of products (TAP) reactor it was concluded that N$_2$O is formed by recombination of two NOad species and by a reaction between NOad and NHx,ad (x = 0,1,2) fragments. Reaction-induced morphological changes were studied with polycrystalline Pt in the mbar range and with stepped Pt single crystals as model systems in the range 10-5-10-1 mbar. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

UPS and XPS results indicate that water adsorbs molecularly at 100K. TDS studies show that water desorbs with approximately zero order kinetics and that a monolayer of water has a maximum desorption rate at 180 K. Heavier coverages exhibit additional desorption from multilayer water (ice) which peaks at temperatures near 165 K. The coadsorption of atomic oxygen with water leads to an increase in the desorption temperature of water of about 30 K. XPS studies of this surface indicate that adsorbed OH species are involved in the reaction mechanism which increases the water desorption temperature.}

Etching in boiling conc. HNO3 led to a thin layer of about 1 nm of a hydrated oxide, PtO2 · xH2O. Identification of the different surface phases was supported by comparative experiments with bulk PtO2. The thermal stability of all compounds was investigated by heating the samples in ultrahigh vacuum. They all decomposed at about 400 K. Initially, not a pure metal phase was formed, but a mixed phase containing Pt metal and oxide, which was stable over a wide temperature range. No oxygen could be detected on the surface at 1070 K by XPS or Auger spectroscopy.}

abstract = {Oxygen adsorption on the Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces was investigated using X-ray photo-emission and thermal desorption spectroscopies. Low pressure (ca. 10−5 Pa) oxygen dosing at near ambient crystal temperature resulted in the formation of dissociated adsorbed species at saturation coverages of nominally 0.2–0.25 monolayer on both surfaces. The combination of higher pressure (ca. 10−3 Pa) and higher surface temperature (570 K) dosing produced a three to five times higher saturation coverage than the low pressure dosing. The effect of dosing condition on the saturation coverage appears to reconcile apparent discrepancies for the Pt(100) surface in the literature. Characterization by XPS of the higher coverage state for oxygen showed that it is in the same chemical state as the oxygen adsorbed at very low coverage. Angle-resolved XPS has shown that in all cases the oxygen appears to reside on the surface with no significant penetration of oxygen into the bulk, as would be characteristic of oxidation. However, some penetration on the surface by oxygen, such as by a place-exchange type restructuring of the first two atomic layers, cannot be entirely ruled out.}

Solid catalysts are highly complex, porous, multi-elemental and often hierarchically structured materials. Scientists are therefore confronted with a formidable challenge to understand the functioning of solid catalysts and, based on this knowledge, to design and make materials with superior performance and overall stability. In this Review, we summarize the latest developments in the spatial and temporal characterization of solid catalysts using synchrotron radiation to uncover their structure and function. Attention is focused on applications using either X-rays or infrared light available from synchrotron radiation sources. In these applications, microscopy and microspectroscopy are used to study heterogeneous catalysts under working conditions and at different length scales, more specifically, from the level of a microreactor down to a single catalyst particle. Finally, we offer a perspective on what instrumental developments at synchrotron radiation sources may bring to realize the dream of recording a molecular movie of a solid catalyst at high temperature and pressure.},

In the area of materials science and computational heterogeneous catalysis, this revolution has led to the development of scientific data repositories, as well as data mining and machine learning tools to investigate the vast materials space. The goal of using these tools is to establish a deeper understanding of the relations between materials properties and activity, selectivity and stability – the important figures of merit in catalysis. Based on these insights, catalyst design principles can be established, which hopefully lead us to discover highly efficient catalysts to solve pressing issues for a sustainable future and the synthesis of highly functional materials, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The inherent complexity of catalytic reactions quests for machine learning methods to efficiently navigate through the high-dimensional hyper-surfaces in structure optimization problems to determine relevant chemical structures and transition states.

abstract={A catalytic process for the selective formation of cis olefins would help minimize the production of unhealthy trans fats during the partial hydrogenation of edible oils. Here we report on the design of such a process on the basis of studies with model systems. Temperature programmed desorption data on single crystals showed that the isomerization of trans olefins to their cis counterparts is promoted by (111) facets of platinum, and that such selectivity is reversed on more open surfaces. Quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the extra stability of cis olefins seen on hydrogen-saturated Pt(111) surfaces may be due to a lesser degree of surface reconstruction, a factor found to be significant in the adsorption on close-packed platinum surfaces. Kinetic data using catalysts made out of dispersed tetrahedral Pt nanoparticles corroborated the selective promotion of the trans-to-cis isomerization on the (111) facets of the metal. Our work provides an example for how catalytic selectivity may be controlled by controlling the shape of the catalytic particles.},

ABSTRACT = {High-temperature oxidation of NH$_3$ on Pt alloy gauzes to NO is widely employed in industry for the production of HNO3, which is used to obtain agricultural fertilizers. Particular attention is paid now to the investigation of the chemical composition of gauzes used in NH$_3$ oxidation. X-ray photoelectron and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopies with the depth of analysis ca. 5 nm and ca. 500 nm were applied to investigate the chemical composition of surface and subsurface layers of the new and used in NH$_3$ oxidation with air at T = 1133 K Pt&ndash;Pd&ndash;Rh&ndash;Ru catalytic gauzes (81, 15, 3.5, 0.5 wt.%, respectively). For all the gauzes, adsorption (OHad, COad), graphitic (Cgr) and oxide (Rh2O3) films were found on the surface of the metallic alloy. Under these films, Cab, Nab and Oab atoms absorbed in the subsurface layers were detected on the gauzes used in NH$_3$ oxidation. The obtained data testify to the penetration of Oab and Nab atoms into deeper layers of the alloy during etching with elevation of the catalyst temperature. Oab atoms were accumulated predominantly on dislocations, etch pits and grain boundaries, whereas Nab atoms intercalated mostly into interstitial sites of the alloy lattice.},

We have investigated the effects of various non-structural parameters, in particular those involved in the construction of the phase shifts, on the resulting structures of the clean Pt(111) and the Pt(111)-p(2×2)-O surfaces. The use of relativistic Pt phase shifts is found to be important in order to determine the adsorption structure accurately. For clean Pt(111), we find the top interlayer spacing is noticeably expanded by 0.025 ± 0.01 Å with a low Rp-factor value of 0.15. For the Pt(111)-p(2×2)-O system we find an Rp-factor of 0.18. O atoms in the p(2×2)-O overlayer are found to adsorb in fcc-hollow sites and induce buckling in both the first and second metal layers. In addition, there is an expansion of the first metal-metal interlayer spacing and a small contraction of the second.}

The high signal/noise ratio achievable in the TEY mode, combined with a continuous scanning of the X-ray energies, makes it possible recording XAS spectra in a few seconds.

The surface area of used samples varied between 0.01 and 0.06 m2/g representing an increase in surface area of 2 to 20 times compared with the surface area of new catalysts. A gauze with RH$_2$O$_3$whiskers exhibited the largest increase in surface area. Except for this abnormal sample, the top gauze in the catalyst pack exhibited the largest surface area. The active surface area of the Pt–Rh gauze catalysts was measured by H$_2$-titration/adsorption. It was assumed that Pt represents the active part of the catalyst. When exposing a spent gauze to H2at 298 K, only platinum oxide on the catalyst surface was titrated. During operation the catalyst deactivates partly by the formation of RH$_2$O$_3$, which was found to be inert against H2at 298 K. However, reduction of used catalyst gauze in H2at 623 K and reoxidation at 623 K made all the RH$_2$O$_3$reactive toward H2at 298 K, indicating the presence of two forms of RH$_2$O$_3$. It was observed that only the first gauze in a gauze pack from a NH$_3$-oxidation reactor comprised a noteworthy active area. All the other gauzes investigated were more or less blocked by RH$_2$O$_3$.}

The hexagonal first layer superstructure of this surface, written in matrix notation as N 1 -1 5, N = 12-14, was imaged with atomic resolution. The fivefold periodicity of this reconstruction was confirmed. The coexistence of differently oriented hexagonal domains on a single terrace was observed. Steps along the longer corrugation length of the surface reconstruction were found, on the average, to follow the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal Pt overlayer rather than any low-index direction of the square substrate. The transition from the N 1 -1 5 reconstruction to the Pt(100)-(1 × 1) surface structure due to exposure to CO and O$_2$ was found to be initiated by heterogeneous nucleation, the nucleation centers being step edges and structural irregularities disrupting the hexagonal structure along a direction close to the hexagonal [1̄ 5] direction. The growth of the (1 × 1) phase was highly anisotropic, i.e. the growth being much faster along the [01̄1] direction (the substrate direction closer to the [N 1] direction of the hexagonal layer) than along the [011] direction. A higher density of atoms in the hexagonal than in the (1 × 1) surface layer causes islands, a single Pt(100) lattice spacing high, to form during the structural transformation. These islands were found to be a mixture of isotropic islands with diameter 10-15 {\AA} and islands highly elongated along the faster growth direction of the (1 × 1) phase. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Deactivation of 2.0-15 nm Pt crystallites supported on alumina and Pt black was studied in a fixed-bed differential reactor during NH$_3$ oxidation by molecular oxygen between 368 and 473 °K. Marked deactivation caused by surface oxidation took place during the first 12 hr on stream. Deactivation occurred only in the presence of both reactants. It was more severe with smaller crystallites and at lower temperatures. The rate decay was best described by a second-order deactivation process. At 433 °K oxygen present in the deactivated 2.7 nm crystallites was about 5 atoms per surface Pt atom, giving an estimated bulk composition of PtO1.7. For the 15.5 nm crystallites the oxygen present in the deactivated crystallites was about 7 atoms per surface Pt atom but the resultant bulk composition was PtO0.5. Deactivation was reversible and activity could be restored by raising the temperature above 473 °K or by reacting with H$_2$ or NH$_3$. Deactivated catalyst slowly released oxygen in reaction with NH$_3$ chemisorbed on the support after the feed O$_2$ and NH$_3$ were turned off. This is a form of reverse spillover. Platinum black studies confirmed the results with the supported catalysts. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

Metal-support interactions in these nanomaterials can have a substantial influence on the catalysis, making metal-support interaction modulation one of the few tools able to enhance catalytic performance. This topic has received much attention in recent years, however, a systematic rationalization of the field is lacking due to the great diversity in catalysts, reactions and modification strategies. In this review, we cover and categorize the recent progress in metal-support interaction tuning strategies to enhance catalytic performance for various reactions. Furthermore, we quantify the productivity enhancements resulting from metal-support interaction control that have been achieved in C1 chemistry in recent years. Our analysis shows that up to fifteen-fold productivity enhancement has been achieved, and that metal-support interaction is most impactful for metal nanoparticles smaller than four nanometres. These findings demonstrate the importance of metal-support interaction to improve performance in catalysis.},

However, experimental investigations of platinum surface oxides have been hampered by technical limitations, preventing in situ investigations at relevant pressures. As a result, the time-dependent evolution of oxide formation has only received superficial treatment. In addition, the amorphous structures of many surface oxides have hindered realistic theoretical studies. Using near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) we show that a time scale of hours (t≥4 h) is required for the formation of platinum surface oxides. These experimental observations are consistent with ReaxFF grand canonical Monte Carlo (ReaxFF-GCMC) calculations, predicting the structures and coverages of stable, amorphous surface oxides at temperatures between 430–680 K and an O$_2$partial pressure of 1 mbar.},

abstract={Heterogeneous catalysts control the rates of chemical reactions by changing the energy levels of bound intermediates relative to one another. However, the design flexibility in catalysis is limited by scaling relations: when a catalyst binds one adsorbate more strongly, it tends to bind similar adsorbates more strongly as well. Here we show how strain can break this constraint by employing a mechanics-based eigenstress model to rationalize the effect of strain on adsorbate--catalyst bonding. This model suggests that the sign of the binding-energy response to strain depends on the coupling of the adsorbate-induced eigenstress with the applied strain; thus, tensile strain can make binding either stronger or weaker, depending on the eigenstress characteristics of the adsorbate on the surface. We then suggest how these principles can be used in conjunction with anisotropic strain to engineer opposite responses of adjacent adsorbates to strain; such effects are expected to allow larger changes to reaction rates than predicted by scaling relations.},

We experimentally measure the strain at interfaces, surfaces and defects in Pt NPs supported on alumina and ceria with atomic resolution using high-precision scanning transmission electron microscopy. The largest strains are observed at the interfaces and are predominantly compressive. Atomic models of Pt NPs with experimentally measured strain distributions are used for first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the CO oxidation reaction. The presence of only a fraction of strained surface atoms is found to affect the turnover frequency. These results provide a quantitative understanding of the relationship between strain and catalytic function and demonstrate that strain engineering can potentially be used for catalyst design.},

But the revolution in x-ray science is still gaining momentum. Even though new storage rings are currently under construction, even more advanced rings are under design (PETRA III and the ultra high energy x-ray source) and the uses of linacs (energy recovery linac, x-ray free electron laser) can take us further into the future, to provide the unique synchrotron light that is so highly prized for today's studies in science in such fields as materials science, physics, chemistry and biology, for example. All these machines are highly reliant upon the consequences of Einstein's special theory of relativity. The consequences of relativity account for the small opening angle of synchrotron radiation in the forward direction and the increasing mass an electron gains as it is accelerated to high energy. These are familiar results to every synchrotron scientist. In this paper we outline not only the origins of SR but discuss how Einstein's strong character and his intuition and excellence have not only marked the physics of the 20th century but provide the foundation for continuing accelerator developments into the 21st century.}

Local strain fields have been produced by Ar-ion implantation and annealing. Thereby the accompanying surface sputter damage is fully healed out with the exception of subsurface cavities filled with argon atoms which have aggregated by bulk diffusion. The resulting nanometer-sized structures contain surface areas of expanded lattice at the tops of the protrusions while around their rim the lattice is compressed relative to the flat surface. Various adsorbates are found to react sensitively to these local lattice distortions. Oxygen atoms adsorb preferentially in the regions of expanded lattice. This preference prevails for all coverages up to the full monolayer with the successive formation of the well-known (2×2)-O, (2×1)-O, (2×2)-3O, and (1×1)-O ordered overlayers on the various parts of the surface. CO at coverages in excess of 0.33 monolayers is found to behave similarly. The experimental results are complemented by investigations of the mixed (O+CO) coadsorbate layer. The reported influence of surface strain on the adsorption energy can be considered as the reverse of strain induction by adsorption, and their direct local demonstration can be used to test theoretical predictions.

abstract = {We investigated the kinetics governing the transition from surface (2D) to bulk (3D) oxide growth on Pt(1 0 0) in ultrahigh vacuum as a function of the surface temperature and the incident flux of an oxygen atom beam. For the incident fluxes examined, the bulk oxide formation rate increases linearly with incident flux ($\Phi$O) as the oxygen coverage increases to about 1.7 ML (monolayer) and depends only weakly on the surface temperature in the limit of low surface temperature (TS < 475 K). In contrast, in the high temperature limit (TS > 525 K), the bulk oxide formation rate increases with $\Phi$O$_2$ for oxygen coverages as high as 1.6 ML, and decreases with increasing surface temperature. We show that the measured kinetics is quantitatively reproduced by a model which assumes that O atoms adsorb on top of the 2D oxide, and that this species acts as a precursor that can either associatively desorb or react with the 2D oxide to form a 3D oxide particle. According to the model, the observed change in the flux and surface temperature dependence of the oxidation rate is due to a change in the rate-controlling steps for bulk oxide formation from reaction at low temperature to precursor desorption at high temperature. From analysis of flux-dependent uptake data, we estimate that the formation rate of a bulk oxide nucleus has a fourth-order dependence on the precursor coverage, which implies a critical configuration for oxide nucleus formation requiring four precursor O atoms. Considering the similarities in the development of surface oxides on various transition metals, the precursor-mediated transition to bulk oxide growth reported here may be a general feature in the oxidation of late transition metal surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

On a CO-covered Pt(100) surface, we prepared oxygen islands which appear dark in the PEEM image due to their higher work function. As the surface is heated to temperatures above 650 K we observe the conversion of these dark islands into very bright ones with work functions much lower than even that of the clean surface arising from an inverted dipole moment of oxygen atoms beneath the surface. We found an activation energy for this conversion of about 15 kcal/mol. Partially transformed oxygen islands were used to study the reactivity and the formation of this species further. CO and H$_2$ both react with subsurface oxygen rather slowly, while at the interface between the subsurface and the chemisorbed phase, both adsorbents accelerate the conversion of parts of the remaining oxygen atoms towards the subsurface state. In contrast, additional oxygen adsorption does not contribute to a further transformation. We propose a qualitative microscopic model for the formation of subsurface oxygen based on experimental evidence.}

@article{Shrestha2014,
abstract = {The development of improved Ammonia Slip Catalysts (ASCs) was pursued by changing the composition and architecture of the critical functions, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and oxidation, needed in the catalyst for high NH 3 oxidation activity and selectivity to N$_2$. Selected space velocities and reactant compositions were used to probe chemical and physical processes that limit the performance of ASCs. On a single component Pt/Al 2O$_3$ catalyst, at the lower space velocity (66k h -1) light-off was characterized by a sharp increase in NH$_3$ conversion to >98\%, while at high space velocity (265k h-1) the transition in conversion was more gradual and the limiting conversion was below 98\%, indicative of transverse transport limitations. The light-off temperature of ammonia oxidation on Pt/Al$_2$O$_3$ catalyst decreased with Pt loading from 0.7 to 10 g Pt/ft3 monolith and, in general, the selectivity to N$_2$ decreased while that of N$_2$O and NO x increased. A dual-layer ASC comprising a top layer of Fe-ZSM-5 and a bottom layer of Pt/Al$_2$O$_3$ resulted in higher selectivity and yield to N$_2$, due to SCR reactions between the counter diffusing NOx formed in the Pt/Al$_2$O$_3$ and NH$_3$ reactant in the Fe-zeolite layer. However, the diffusion resistance provided by the Fe-ZSM-5 layer inhibited the overall ammonia conversion at high space velocity. When Fe-zeolite and Pt/Al$_2$O$_3$ particles were mixed and washcoated as a single layer, this led to an increase in NH 3 conversion at high space velocity due to a decrease in the diffusion barrier that was observed with the dual-layer structure. When SCR and oxidation catalyst particles were contiguous in the washcoat structure as in single-layer mixed catalysts, the N$_2$ yield was lower due to Pt-catalyzed NH$_3$ oxidation, compared to the dual-layer ASC, which was especially apparent at low space velocity. The dual-layer catalyst was superior to the mixed layer catalyst at high temperatures, exhibiting lower NO x and higher N$_2$ yields whereas the mixed catalyst out-performed the dual-layer catalyst at low temperature by exhibiting lower N$_2$O and higher N$_2$ yield. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The low-index (111), (100) and (110) surfaces as well as selected high-index surfaces have been considered. We predict the stability of novel structures such as the c(4 × 6) on Cu(100) and the $\alpha$-PtO$_2$  trilayer on Pt(100). The knowledge of the Gibbs free surface energies allows us to predict the adsorbate-induced changes in the thermodynamic equilibrium shape of metal nanoparticles. At low oxygen chemical potential, corresponding to clean surfaces, the (111) facets dominate the particle shape, with a significant contribution from (100) facets. But even under these conditions a small fraction of the overall surface corresponds to more open facets. As oxygen adsorption sets in, their contribution becomes larger. At high oxygen partial pressures, surface oxides form on the platinum-group metals. They do not only display different chemical properties than the metal, but also determine the exposed surface orientations of the particles. The latter effect might play an important role for the catalytic activity of transition metal nanoparticles.}

abstract = {Despite its importance in oxidation catalysis, the active phase of Pt remains uncertain, even for the Pt(111) single-crystal surface. Here, using a ReactorSTM, the catalytically relevant structures are identified as two surface oxides, different from bulk $\alpha$-PtO$_2$, previously observed. They are constructed from expanded oxide rows with a lattice constant close to that of $\alpha$-PtO$_2$, either assembling into spoked wheels, 1-5 bar O$_2$, or closely packed in parallel lines, above 2.2 bar. Both are only ordered at elevated temperatures (400-500 K). The triangular oxide can also form on the square lattice of Pt(100). Under NO and CO oxidation conditions, similar features are observed. Furthermore, both oxides are unstable outside the O$_2$ atmosphere, indicating the presence of active O atoms, crucial for oxidation catalysts.},

As the surface is heated to temperatures above 650 K we observe the conversion of these dark islands into very bright ones with work functions much lower than even that of the clean surface. These findings are attributed to a change in the dipole moment of the adsorbed oxygen induced by their migration beneath the surface. A total work-function decrease of up to 1.2 eV has been evaluated independently using a Scanning Photoemission Microscope (SPM).

abstract = {To understand the "pressure and material gap" in the platinum-catalyzed ammonia oxidation over Pt, the reaction was studied over a wide range of pressures (10-3-105 Pa) and temperatures (293-1073 K) with different Pt catalysts: stepped Pt(533) single crystal, knitted Pt gauze, and Pt foil. Experiments were supplemented by theory applying DFT calculations. It was concluded that the primary reaction step of NH$_3$ oxidation, stripping of hydrogen from the NH$_3$ molecule, is favored by the presence of surface O and OH species. The latter species are more active for dehydrogenation of NH2 and NH fragments. NO and N$_2$ are the only nitrogen-containing products detected under UHV conditions (p<10-1 Pa). N$_2$O was observed, however, at about 6 Pa (peak pressure) in the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor and under ambient pressure conditions of 100 kPa in a microstructured reactor. The pressure dependence of N$_2$O formation is suggested to be related to a minimum surface coverage by reaction intermediates required for N$_2$O formation, which is a real "pressure gap" phenomenon. Independently of the pressure range (10-3-105 Pa) and the type of Pt specimen, N$_2$ formation prevails at low temperatures (<700 K), whereas NO production increases with temperature and becomes the dominant reaction channel at high temperature. Catalyst characterization by SEM revealed a reconstruction of the Pt surface after ammonia oxidation at ambient pressure. The degree of surface restructuring is related to the total exposure of the catalyst to the reactants. Surface roughening contributes to activation of the catalyst and changes in its selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We find that surface tension of the clusters induces a compression, which weakens the bonding of adsorbates compared with the bonding on extended surfaces. The effect is largest for close-packed surfaces and almost nonexistent on the more reactive steps and edges. The effect is largest at low coverage and decreases, even changing sign, at higher coverages where the strain changes from compressive to tensile. Quantum size effects also influence adsorption energies but only below a critical size of 1.5 nm for platinum and 2.5 nm for gold. We develop a model to describe the strain-induced size effects on adsorption energies, which is able to describe the influence of surface structure, adsorbate, metal, and coverage.},

These steady-state reaction studies were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum system equipped with low-energy electron diffraction for determination of surface structures, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for surface composition determinations, and mass spectroscopy for determination of gas-phase compositions. The oxidation of ammonia proceeds rapidly above 150 °C on the Pt(S) — 12(111) × (111) surface; the products observed are molecular nitrogen, nitric oxide, and water. For a stoichiometric mixture of ammonia and molecular oxygen, nitrogen formation predominates at low temperature (150 to 400 °C) while nitric oxide formation predominates above 400 °C. Kinetic studies done with excess ammonia reveal that the nitrogen formation rate is first order in gas-phase oxygen pressure but saturates with increasing ammonia pressure. Under these conditions the surface is primarily covered with nitrogen-containing species. Kinetic studies done in excess oxygen indicate that nitric oxide formation is first order in ammonia pressure but saturates with increasing adsorbed oxygen pressure. Under these conditions the surface is covered with adsorbed oxygen (as determined by AES). Thermal desorption of oxygen adsorbed on the platinum surface during ammonia oxidation indicates that the oxygen is present as oxygen atoms bound to the step edge sites. The observations that the reaction rates for both branches of this reaction saturate with respect to increasing reactant pressure just as the step edge sites become saturated indicate that the step edge sites play a predominant role in both reaction branches.}

Unique and reproducible steady state rates were observed in all experiments for temperatures up to 1400 °C at all compositions. Rates of individual reactions could be fit by Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions with constant parameters, and comparisons of these parameters on different metals give reasonable qualitative interpretations for observed differences between metals. The competition of NO and NH$_3$ for adsorption sites appears to be important in determining the rates of various reactions. Differences in selectivity between metals are caused by the different temperature dependences of rates of individual reactions rather than by uniform differences in rates. Kinetics measured at low pressures (1–2 Torr) are used to estimate selectivities of NO and N$_2$ production at conditions of industrial nitric acid production. The predicted selectivity and optimum temperature and composition on Pt assuming simple models of flow patterns over the catalyst gauze match closely those observed in the high pressure process.}

Reactions studied under reaction controlled conditions are unimolecular decomposition of NO and of NH$_3$, the bimolecular reaction of NH$_3$ and NO to form N$_2$, and NH$_3$ oxidation to NO and to N$_2$. In all reactions and at all temperatures, unique steady-states were observed, and these were attained in less than 2 seconds after adjusting pressures and temperatures. Comparison is made with results obtained in a 1 atm flow reactor, and some possible effects of mass transfer limitation on the selectivity are discussed. The selectivity of NO vs. N$_2$ production appears to be controlled almost entirely by the NONH3 reaction for T ⪅ 1000°C, and by unimolecular decomposition of NH$_3$ for higher temperatures. The rates of NH$_3$ decomposition and of NO reduction by NH$_3$ are semi-quantitatively described with simple Langmuir—Hinshelwood kinetics.

From the calculation of the effective part of the sample surface that participates in the diffraction phenomena at each step of the scan, a more accurate correction factor than those commonly used is derived and the evolution of the line shape along a zero-width rod is explained. Secondly, the case of finite-width rods, under the point-like sample approximation, is considered: the influence of the partial integration, as a result of the detector in-plane acceptance, of a rod with an anisotropic in-plane shape, is studied and leads to an analytical expression for the corresponding correction factor.

abstract = {The mechanism and kinetics of NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism has been a subject of interest for decades, although it is attracting renewed interest in connection with hydrogen generation for fuel cells. This system represents an example of a most peculiar nonlinear catalytic reaction sequence for which, even though the mechanistic steps are well-accepted and their DFT energetics widely studied, the microkinetics have not yet been fully investigated. In fact, there is no agreement even as to which step(s) are rate-limiting. Employing our Reaction Route (RR) Graph approach and the corresponding electrical analogy, we investigate in detail the steady-state microkinetics of the seven-step NH 3 decomposition reaction mechanism. Based on an Ohm's law representation of kinetics, we develop an accurate quasi steady-state (QSS) rate expression for the complete sequence, not possible with the usual QSS approach, which provides only numerical results for the nonlinear sequence. Further, it allows the rate-limiting step(s) to be identified in a rigorous manner, based simply on a comparison of the step resistances. Combining this with identification of the most abundant reactive intermediate (MARI), the mechanism and the rate expressions are pruned to provide a simplified rate law that is found to be in complete agreement with numerical QSS analysis as well as with our experimental data on Fe without any fitted parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The oxidation of the platinum (111) single crystal surface and the formation of platinum dioxide have been studied by in situ surface x-ray diffraction and x-ray reflectivity. At an oxygen partial pressure of 500mbar and at temperatures from 520 to 910K, the experiments disclose the growth of two atomic layers of a bulk-like, strongly distorted $\alpha$-PtO$_2$. The epitaxial Pt oxide layer is oriented hexagon on hexagon with respect to the Pt(111) surface leading to a (8 × 8) superstructure surface unit cell. In a second set of experiments, a 100 thick epitaxial Pt(111) film on sapphire was exposed to oxygen. At 670K and near atmospheric oxygen pressures we find the formation of a several angstrom thick oxide layer. After annealing the sample at 720K in a vacuum the oxide layer desorbs, recovering the 100 thick Pt film. Subsequent oxidation at 720K and reduction cycles lead to a slight increase in surface roughness and the formation of macroscopically visible holes in the Pt film. These results point to a Pt re-dispersion which sets in during chemical reactions at atmospheric pressures. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The interaction between nitric oxide and ammonia was studied in the sequential pulse mode applying 15NO. Differently labelled nitrogen and nitrous oxide molecules were detected. In both, direct NO decomposition and NH$_3$–NO interaction, N$_2$O formation was most marked between 573 and 673K, whereas N$_2$ formation dominated at higher temperatures. An unusual interruption of nitrogen formation in the 15NO pulse at 473K was caused by an inhibiting effect of adsorbed NO species. The detailed analysis of the product distribution at this temperature clearly indicates different reaction pathways leading to the product formation. Nitrogen formation occurs via recombination of nitrogen atoms formed by dissociation of nitric oxide or/and complete dehydrogenation of ammonia. N$_2$O is formed via recombination of adsorbed NO molecules. Additionally, both products are formed via interactions between adsorbed ammonia fragments and nitric oxide.}

@article{Heinz1982,
abstract = {The structure transition Pt(100) 1 × 1 → hex is observed by means of LEED intensities. The clean metastable 1 × 1 phase is prepared by intermediate NO adsorption. The transition to the hexagonal surface structure, which is an activated process, is initiated by raising the temperature. Integral intensities for both integer order spots as well as for superstructure spots are taken as function of time for constant elevated temperatures and as function of temperature for continuous temperature increase. The development of spot profiles is recorded as well. It turns out that the spot half width of integer order spots remains constant during the transition. Intermediate stages during the structure change show considerable background which is concentrated to streaks and indicates structural disorder. The superstructure spots grow up from the streaks giving first a 1 × 5 pattern from which the final structure results by spot splitting in the very last stage of the transition. Their intensity increase is delayed with respect to the decrease of integer order spots. They occur already with a comparably narrow half width, which remains constant in a first part of the transition. In the second part, especially during the final splitting, a further reduction is observed. The results are qualitatively discussed to give a geometrical model of the reconstruction based on the shift of atomic rows. Quantitative evaluation of the intensity-time dependences results in the activation energy of the transition, $\Delta$E≈1.1 eV. From the temperature dependent measurements the surface Debye temperatures of the 1 × 1 and reconstructed phases are deduced to be roughly equal. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Ammonia oxidation over different Pt single crystal orientations and a Pt foil has been studied in the 10−5 to 10−2 mbar range with rate measurements and LEED. The reaction exhibits only a moderate structure sensitivity with the activity varying in the sequence Pt foil:Pt(533):Pt(865):Pt(443):Pt(100)=6:4:4:2:1. The activity is apparently mainly determined by the oxygen sticking coefficient which reaches 0.14 on the Pt foil. Broad hystereses in the reaction rates upon cyclic variation of the temperature are associated with reversible structural changes. The extent of reaction-induced structural changes depends strongly on the orientation, the total pressure and also on the ratio of the reactants NH$_3$/O$_2$. On Pt(533) and Pt(443) the extent of restructuring and the hysteretic behavior was found to depend in a non-monotonic way on the total pressure. Exposure to reaction conditions at 10−3 mbar creates a disordered surface as seen in LEED with no LEED spots visible; but after exposure to reaction conditions at 10−2 mbar the integral order beams in LEED are again visible.}

One surprising result of these studies has been the discovery of subsurface oxygen on Pt(1 0 0). The formation of subsurface oxygen has been reported previously on Pt(1 0 0) during CO oxidation at low pressures (<1 × 10-4 Torr). This communication reports the formation of subsurface oxygen at intermediate pressures (∼0.1 Torr). These observations show that subsurface oxygen plays a role in catalytic CO oxidation and pattern formation, which has implications for catalysts operated at higher pressures. New microkinetic models of CO oxidation that incorporate subsurface oxygen are discussed. Results of these models are qualitatively similar to experimental observations of subsurface oxygen, confirming the importance of this species in the reaction dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, the (1 × 1) surface exhibits an ability to dissociate NH$_3$.

   abstract = {The introduction of in situ techniques has had a vast impact on research and development in the area of heterogeneous catalysis as emphasized in many reviews and monographs. Recently, the number of in situ techniques that can give information at the atomic scale has increased significantly and new possibilities exist for making the measurements under industrially relevant conditions. In order to fully exploit the results from the in situ and operando studies, it has also become increasingly gainful to combine the experimental studies with theoretical methodologies based on, for example, Density Functional Theory (DFT). This has allowed one to extract more detailed atomic-scale information from the measurements and it has also allowed the establishment of detailed structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, the interplay between in situ techniques and theory has helped bridging the pressure gap such that in situ information obtained at conditions far from industrial ones may be used in a more relevant manner. Here, we will illustrate how microscopy-, spectroscopy- and X-ray-based techniques in combination with experimental and theoretical surface science methods can aid industrial catalyst developments. We will do this by presenting examples of our current understanding and latest developments in the areas of heterogeneous nano-particle catalysts for methanol synthesis, steam reforming and hydrotreating. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {The kinetics of the CO oxidation reaction were examined on the Pt(100)-(5 × 20) surface under UHV conditions. The transient isothermal rate of CO$_2$ production was examined both for exposure of an oxygen-dosed surface to a beam of CO and for exposure of a CO-dosed surface to a beam of O$_2$. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics were found to apply in both cases. For the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen atoms, the reaction rate was dependent upon the square-root of the oxygen atom coverage, suggesting that oxygen atoms were adsorbed in islands on this surface. The oxidation of preadsorbed CO was observed only when the initial CO concentrations were less than 0.5 monolayer (c(2 × 2) structure), suggesting that the dissociative adsorption of oxygen required adjacent four-fold surface sites. The activation energy calculated for the reaction of CO with preadsorbed oxygen was 31.4 kcal/mol. This value was 30 kcal/mol greater than the activation energy measured for the reaction of O$_2$ with preadsorbed CO. Strong attractive interactions within the oxygen islands were at least partially responsible for this difference. The reaction kinetics in both cases changed dramatically below 300 K; this change is believed to be due to phase separation at the lower temperature. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

As a consequence, numerous nanofabrication methods have emerged that address various weaknesses, but none have, as of yet, demonstrated a large-area processing route capable of defining organized surfaces of nanostructures with the architectural diversity and complexity that is routinely displayed in colloidal syntheses. Here, a hybrid fabrication strategy is demonstrated in which nanoimprint lithography is combined with templated dewetting and liquid-phase syntheses that is able to realize periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures over square centimeter areas. The process is inexpensive, can be carried out on a benchtop, and requires modest levels of instrumentation. Demonstrated are three fabrication schemes yielding arrays of core-shell, core-void-shell, and core-void-nanoframe structures using liquid-phase syntheses involving heteroepitaxial deposition, galvanic replacement, and dealloying. With the field of nanotechnology being increasingly reliant on the engineering of desirable physicochemical responses through architectural control, the fabrication strategy provides a platform for advancing devices reliant on addressable arrays or the collective response from an ensemble of identical nanostructures.},

The resulting data can well be fitted by I(γr) = a cos γr + (1-a) cos7γr with a being an adjustable parameter which varies with the surface conditions. The cos γr part is ascribed to particles which were completely accommodated with their translational energy to the surface temperature before leaving the surface, while the cos7γr channel corresponds to molecules carrying excess translational energy from crossing the activation barrier of the surface reaction. The fraction of thermally accommodated particles increases by the presence of steps or “subsurface oxide”, and decreases with O and CO coverage as well as with increasing temperature. The effect of coverage can qualitatively be attributed to the varying participation of defect sites in product formation, while the influence of surface temperature is well reproduced in the framework of a general theoretical model. Scattering experiments with CO2 revealed that the trapping probability for this molecule (in the temperature range interesting here) is of the order of 0.5, thus confirming the conclusion of incomplete thermal accommodation of a CO2 molecule interacting with a Pt(111) surface.}

abstract  ="The conversion of CO$_2$ into fuels and useful chemicals has been intensively pursued for renewable{,} sustainable and green energy. However{,} due to the negative adiabatic electron affinity (EA) and large ionization potential (IP){,} the CO$_2$ molecule is chemically inert{,} thus making the conversion difficult under normal conditions. Novel catalysts{,} which have high stability{,} superior efficiency and low cost{,} are urgently needed to facilitate the conversion. As the first step to design such catalysts{,} understanding the mechanisms involved in CO$_2$ conversion is absolutely indispensable. In this review{,} we have summarized the recent theoretical progress in mechanistic studies based on density functional theory{,} kinetic Monte Carlo simulation{,} and microkinetics modeling. We focus on reaction channels{,} intermediate products{,} the key factors determining the conversion of CO$_2$ in solid–gas interface thermocatalytic reduction and solid–liquid interface electrocatalytic reduction. Furthermore{,} we have proposed some possible strategies for improving CO$_2$ electrocatalysis and also discussed the challenges in theory{,} model construction{,} and future research directions."

abstract = {The low-temperature deactivation of a platinum sponge catalyst used for ammonia oxidation was studied with the positron emission profiling technique (PEP). Evidence that irreversibly adsorbed nitrogen species deactivate the catalyst is presented. Two reactivity regimes are distinguished. Initial fast N$_2$ production at low surface coverage and a relatively slow N$_2$ and N$_2$O production at steady state when the surface is fully covered. The fast deactivation of the platinum sponge is mainly caused by adsorbed nitrogen species. The formation of PtO is relatively slow compared to surface nitride. The fast initial deactivation of platinum sponge by nitrogen and oxygen species is greatly retarded at temperatures above 388 K. Temperature-programmed reaction together with temperature-programmed desorption experiments show reactivation of the catalyst above this temperature.}

A dewetting equilibrium shape of Pt nanoparticles was observed with a low-index plane orientation relation: Pt(111)[211]∥$\gamma$- Al$_2$O$_3$(111)[211] and Pt(100)[011]∥$\gamma$-Al 2O$_3$(111)[211]. Lattice-matching epitaxy of Pt(110)∥$\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) was found across their interface to maintain a minimum interface strain during particle growth. To quantitatively interpret the interfacial energy and adhesion energy of the nanoparticles, the Wulff-Kaischew theorem was applied by taking into account the $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ support modifications to the equilibrium shape of nanoparticles. The present approach quantitatively solved the adhesion energy of the particle/support and could help to interpret nanoparticles equilibrium shape and stability. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

It is shown that this stable phase differs from the first one by a slight rotation of the hexagonal surface layer by 0.7°. For Ir(100) only the well known (1 × 5) superstructure is observed without any rotation of the outer layer. The rotation angle of 0.7° for platinum and the stability of the unrelated structure for iridium can be interpreted by simple calculations of the coordination of surface atoms with those of the second layer. The method assumes that the surface layer is of ideal hexagonal structure in the case of platinum and nearly hexagonal in the case of iridium. The results are in good agreement with the experiment. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

It is shown in reconstruction simulations that the phase maps of objects with strong step-like phase changes are more precisely retrieved than the corresponding modulus values. The simulations suggest that the reconstruction precision for both phase and modulus can be improved by employing a modulus homogenization (MH) constraint. This approach was tested on experimental data from a highly strained Fe-Al crystal which also features antiphase domain boundaries yielding characteristic $\pi$ phase shifts of the (001) superlattice reflection. The impact of MH is significant and this study outlines a successful method towards imaging of strong phase objects using the next generation of coherent X-ray sources, including X-ray free-electron lasers.},

Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron lasers are briefly discussed. The literature on X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy is described and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is presented. }

The technique provides three-dimensional lattice strain fields from which surface reactivity maps can be inferred. However, all experiments published so far have investigated particles an order of magnitude larger than those used in practical applications. Studying smaller particles quickly becomes demanding as the diffracted intensity falls. Here, in situ nanodiffraction data from 60 nm Au nanoparticles under electrochemical control collected at the hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline of MAX IV, NanoMAX, are presented. Two-dimensional image reconstructions of these particles are produced, and it is estimated that NanoMAX, which is now open for general users, has the requisites for three-dimensional imaging of particles of a size relevant for catalytic applications. This represents the first demonstration of coherent X-ray diffraction experiments performed at a diffraction-limited storage ring, and illustrates the importance of these new sources for experiments where coherence properties become crucial.},

Its main advantage is that information about the three-dimensional structure of the object is already contained in a single image. This makes it useful for the reconstruction of fragile and non-reproducible particles without the need for tomographic measurements. However, currently there is no efficient numerical inversion algorithm available that is capable of determining the object's structure in real time. Neural networks, on the other hand, excel in image processing tasks suited for such purpose. Here we show how a physics-informed deep neural network can be used to reconstruct complete three-dimensional object models on a voxel grid from single two-dimensional wide-angle scattering patterns. We demonstrate its universal reconstruction capabilities for silver nanoclusters, where the network uncovers novel geometric structures that reproduce the experimental scattering data with very high precision.},

abstract = {Compton scattering is generally neglected in diffraction experiments because the incoherent radiation it generates does not give rise to interference effects and therefore is negligible at Bragg peaks. However, as the scattering volume is~reduced, the difference between the Rayleigh (coherent) and Compton (incoherent) contributions at Bragg peaks diminishes and the incoherent part may become substantial. The consequences can be significant for coherent diffraction imaging at high scattering angles: the incoherent radiation produces background that smears out the secondary interference fringes, affecting thus the achievable resolution of the technique. Here, a criterion that relates the object shape and the resolution is introduced. The Compton contribution for several object shapes is quantified, and it is shown that the maximum achievable resolution along different directions has a strong dependence on the crystal shape and size.},

abstract = {Abstract A nanoparticle with well-defined surfaces, prepared through colloidal chemistry, enables it to be studied as a model heterogeneous catalyst. The colloidal synthetic approach provides versatile tools to control the size and shape of nanoparticles. Traditional nucleation and growth mechanisms have been utilized to understand how nanoparticles can be uniformly synthesized and unprecedented shapes can be controlled. Now, the size of metal particles can be controlled to cluster regimes by using dendrimers. By using seeds and foreign atoms, specific synthetic environments such as seeded growth and crystal overgrowth can be induced to generate various shaped mono- or bi-metallic, core/shell, or branched nanostructures. For green chemistry, catalysis in 21st century is aiming for 100 \% selectivity to produce only one desired product at high turnover rates. Recent studies on nanoparticle catalysts clearly demonstrate size and shape dependent selectivity in many catalytic reactions. By combining in situ surface characterization techniques, real-time monitoring of nanoparticles can be performed under reaction environments, thus identifying several molecular factors affecting catalytic activity and selectivity.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the high-resolution volumetric 3D shape from images is challenging due to the cubic growth of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fourier-based method that reconstructs a 3D shape from images in a 2D space by predicting slices in the frequency domain. According to the Fourier slice projection theorem, we introduce a thickness map to bridge the domain gap between images in the spatial domain and slices in the frequency domain. The thickness map is the 2D spatial projection of the 3D shape, which is easily predicted from the input image by a general convolutional neural network. Each slice in the frequency domain is the Fourier transform of the corresponding thickness map. All slices constitute a 3D descriptor and the 3D shape is the inverse Fourier transform of the descriptor. Using slices in the frequency domain, our method can transfer the 3D shape reconstruction from the 3D space into the 2D space, which significantly reduces the computational cost. The experiment results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.},

We demonstrate the approach on experimental coherent Bragg diffraction data measured with 52 keV x-rays from a nanocrystalline sample. From this sample, we resolve the fine fringe detail of a high-energy x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction pattern to an upsampling factor of 16 of the native pixel pitch of 30 &#x03BC;m of a charge-integrating fastCCD detector. This was accomplished by analysis of individual photon locations in a series of &#x201C;nearly-dark&#x201D; instances of the diffraction pattern that each contain only a handful of photons. Central to our approach was the adaptation of the UNLOC photon fitting routine for PALM/STORM to the hard x-ray regime to handle much smaller point spread functions, which required a different statistical test for photon detection and for sub-pixel localization. A comparison to a photon-localization strategy used in the x-ray community (&#x201C;droplet analysis&#x201D;) showed that XR-UNLOC provides significant improvement in super-resolution. We also developed a metric by which to estimate the limit of reliable upsampling with XR-UNLOC under a given set of experimental conditions in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of a photon detection event and the size of the point spread function for guiding future x-ray experiments in many disciplines where detector pixelation limits must be overcome.},

Indeed, at the nanoscale, their functional properties are largely influenced by elastic strain and depend critically on the presence of crystal defects. It is thus of prime importance to be able to monitor, by noninvasive means, the stability of the microstructure of nano-objects against external stimuli such as mechanical load. Here we demonstrate the potential of Bragg coherent diffraction imaging for such measurements, by imaging in 3D the evolution of the microstructure of a nanocrystal exposed to in situ mechanical loading. Not only could we observe the evolution of the internal strain field after successive loadings, but we also evidenced a transient microstructure hosting a stable dislocation loop. The latter is fully characterized from its characteristic displacement field. The mechanical behavior of this small crystal is clearly at odds with what happens in bulk materials where many dislocations interact. Moreover, this original in situ experiment opens interesting possibilities for the investigation of plastic deformation at the nanoscale.},

Such a discontinuity gives rise, in general, to rods of scattering in reciprocal space which are most intense close to the Bragg peaks tau and are well defined for sufficiently smooth surfaces. For wave-vector transfer Q= tau +q the q-dependence of the intensity of scattering gives information on the topographic structure of the crystal surface. Experimental results on crystals of GaAs and KTaO$_3$, with surfaces prepared in various ways, were obtained using conventional X-ray techniques with a rotating anode source and can be described by a continuum model of the surface. There are discrepancies between the predictions of the models and the experimental results and these suggest that further experiments are needed to achieve a more complete understanding.}

However, the undersampling of the diffraction signal due to Fourier-space compression at high x-ray energies renders conventional phase-retrieval algorithms unsuitable for three-dimensional reconstruction. To address this problem, we utilize a phase-retrieval method with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored for undersampled diffraction data measured with coarse-pitched detector pixels that bin the underlying signal. With our approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional strained crystallites from an undersampled Bragg diffraction data set subject to pixel-area integration without having to physically upsample the diffraction signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of Fourier-space compression during phase retrieval provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy BCDI data, which is otherwise intractable.},

abstract = {Topological defects can markedly alter nanomaterial properties. This presents opportunities for "defect engineering," where desired functionalities are generated through defect manipulation. However, imaging defects in working devices with nanoscale resolution remains elusive. We report three-dimensional imaging of dislocation dynamics in individual battery cathode nanoparticles under operando conditions using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging. Dislocations are static at room temperature and mobile during charge transport. During the structural phase transformation, the lithium-rich phase nucleates near the dislocation and spreads inhomogeneously. The dislocation field is a local probe of elastic properties, and we find that a region of the material exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio at high voltage. Operando dislocation imaging thus opens a powerful avenue for facilitating improvement and rational design of nanostructured materials.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen a tremendous growth in the field of coherent X-ray diffractive imaging, in large part due to X-ray free-electron lasers which provide a peak brilliance billions of times higher than that of synchrotrons. However, this rapid development in terms of hardware has not been matched on the software side. The release of Hawk is intended to close this gap. To the authors knowledge Hawk is the first publicly available and fully open source software program for reconstructing images from continuous diffraction patterns. The software handles all steps leading from a raw diffraction pattern to a reconstructed two-dimensional image including geometry determination, background correction, masking and phasing. It also includes preliminary three-dimensional support and support for graphics processing units using the Compute Unified Device Architecture, which speeds up processing by orders of magnitude compared to a single central processing unit. Hawk implements numerous algorithms and is easily extended. This, in combination with its open-source licence, provides a platform for other groups to test, develop and distribute their own algorithms.

The method can potentially reach nanometer-scale spatial resolution thanks to the advances in synchrotron design that dramatically increase coherent flux. However, there are experimental bottlenecks that may limit the image reconstruction quality from future high signal-to-noise ratio measurements. In this work we show that angular uncertainty of the sample orientation with respect to a fixed incoming beam is one example of such a factor, and we present a method to mitigate the resulting artifacts. On the basis of an alternative formulation of the forward problem, we design a phase retrieval algorithm which enables the simultaneous reconstruction of the object and determination of the exact angular position corresponding to each diffraction pattern in the data set. We have tested the algorithm performance on simulated data for different degrees of angular uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio.},

Phase retrieval and its applications have been attractive research topics in optics and photonics, for example, in biomedical imaging, astronomical imaging, and so on. Most conventional phase retrieval methods have used iterative processes to recover phase information; however, the calculation speed and convergence with these methods are serious issues in real-time monitoring applications. Machine-learning-based methods are promising for addressing these issues. Here, we numerically compare conventional methods and a machine-learning-based method in which a convolutional neural network is employed. Simulations with several conditions show that the machine-learning-based method realizes fast and robust phase recovery compared with the conventional methods. We also numerically demonstrate machine-learning-based phase retrieval from noisy measurements with a noisy training data set for improving the noise robustness. The machine-learning-based approach used in this study may increase the impact of phase retrieval, which is useful in various fields, where phase retrieval has been used as a fundamental tool.},

Electron microscopy shows that during the combustion, two distinct crystalline systems develop, namely, small rhodium-rich crystals and large platinum-rich geometric crystals with well-developed facets. Chemical analysis of the surface by XPS associated with ion sputtering shows that the catalyst deactivation may be caused by the segregation of rhodium at the surface, resulting from the volatilization of platinum oxide at high temperature after the oxidation of Rh and Pt. The small rhodium-rich crystals are identified as Rh2O3 and the oxidation ratio (Rh2O3Rh + Rh2O3) varies with the location of the gauzes in the catalytic pack: it is 0.2 at the head of the reactor and reaches up to 0.8 in the tail.}

The NO saturation coverage was found to increase from 0.23 at 305 K to 0.54 at 120 K. At both adsorption temperatures and at coverages less than 0.15 only a single adsorption state was populated characterized by an O(1s) binding energy of 530.6 eV and a dipole moment of 0.42 D, negative end outwards. At higher coverages, a second state characterized by an O(1s) binding energy of 532.5 eV appeared. These two states are associated with bridge and linearly bonded NO, respectively, in accordance with existing vibrational data. For high NO coverages achieved after adsorption at 120 K the XPS O(1s) spectra produce evidence of an adsorbed NO species characterized by an O(1s) binding energy of ~ 531.1 eV.

It has been observed that the noble metals are mostly in the metallic state, and catalyst deactivation is determined by rhodium enrichment in the alloy surface. In the cases of a strong ``faceting'' of the wires, which tends to homogenize the catalyst surface, a good agreement between the surface composition determined by EDX and XPS was found. The Pt/Pd and Rh/Pd ratios in the catchment gauzes decreased markedly from the top to the bottom gauzes of the pack, indicating the directional effect of metal condensation or deposition from the gas stream.},

A thin film is found on the surface of the initial gauze containing an oxide layer of Rh2O3 with a thickness of {\textasciitilde}2 nm, on the surface of which an inhomogeneous graphite-like layer 10--50 nm thick is located. It is shown that the heat treatment of gauzes in air leads to the partial removal of the surface graphite-like film that forms the reticulated structure on the wire surface. The treatment of gauzes in an ammonia atmosphere leads to the complete removal of the graphite-like and oxide layers and to the growth of metal grains of {\textasciitilde}10 $\mu$m. After the catalytic reaction of NH$_3$ oxidation, a deep structural rearrangement of the surface layer of the wire takes place, as a result of which crystalline metal agglomerates of {\textasciitilde}10 $\mu$m are formed. It is supposed that the reaction of NH$_3$ molecules with oxygen atoms penetrated on the defects leads to the local increase of temperature, due to which the metal atoms emerge on the surface and form large crystalline agglomerates and pores in the region of the grain boundaries.},

abstract={Selective oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide over platinum-group metal alloy gauzes is the crucial step for nitric acid production, a century-old yet greenhouse gas and capital intensive process. Therefore, developing alternative ammonia oxidation technologies with low environmental impacts and reduced catalyst cost are of significant importance. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a chemical looping ammonia oxidation catalyst and process to replace the costly noble metal catalysts and to reduce greenhouse gas emission. The proposed process exhibit near complete NH$_3$ conversion and exceptional NO selectivity with negligible N$_2$O production, using nonprecious V2O5 redox catalyst at 650 oC. Operando spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations point towards a modified, temporally separated Mars-van Krevelen mechanism featuring a reversible V5+/V4+ redox cycle. The V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O sites are suggested to be the catalytically active center leading to the formation of the oxidation products. Meanwhile, both V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O and doubly coordinated oxygen participate in the hydrogen transfer process. The outstanding performance originates from the low activation energies for the successive hydrogen abstraction, facile NO formation as well as the easy regeneration of V{\thinspace}={\thinspace}O species. Our results highlight a transformational process in extending the chemical looping strategy to producing base chemicals in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.},

Its use as an oxidizer in the area of propellants, however, is not as extensive as in explosive compositions or gas generators. With the growing demand for environmental friendly chlorine free propellants, many attempts have been made of late to investigate oxidizers producing innocuous combustion products. AN, unlike the widely used ammonium perchlorate, produces completely ecofriendly smokeless products. Besides, it is one of the cheapest and easily available compounds. However, its use in large rocket motors is restricted due to some of its adverse characteristics like hygroscopicity, near room temperature phase transformation involving a volume change, and low burning rate (BR) and energetics. The review is an attempt to consolidate the information available on the various issues pertaining to its use as a solid propellant oxidizer. Detailed discussions on the aspects relating to phase modifications, decomposition chemistry, and BR and energetics of AN-based propellants, are presented. To make the review more comprehensive brief descriptions of the history, manufacture, safety, physical and chemical properties and various other applications of the salt are also included.}

We investigate the economic performance of the production complex through a model-based dynamic optimization approach, considering scenarios with or without incorporation of intermittent wind power as well as deployment of battery storage. In all cases, the wind power integration proves to be economic with a peak-to-base load ratio of up to 2.3. The new process reduces primary energy consumption by more than 13\% compared to conventional technologies. However, it is only economically competitive with help of either a low-cost battery storage or a higher carbon price on fossil fuels.

The ability to identify defects from the diffraction pattern alone would be a significant advantage when targeting specific defect types and accelerates experiment design and execution. Here, we exploit a computational tool based on a three-dimensional (3D) parametric atomistic model and a convolutional neural network to predict dislocations in a crystal from its 3D coherent diffraction pattern.

abstract = {Ptychography is a rapidly developing scanning microscopy which is able to view the internal structures of samples at a high resolution beyond the illumination size. The achieved spatial resolution is theoretically dose-limited. A broadband source can provide much higher flux compared with a monochromatic source; however, it conflicts with the necessary coherence requirements of this coherent diffraction imaging technique. In this paper, a multi-wavelength reconstruction algorithm has been developed to deal with the broad bandwidth in ptychography. Compared with the latest development of mixed-state reconstruction approach, this multi-wavelength approach is more accurate in the physical model, and also considers the spot size variation as a function of energy due to the chromatic focusing optics. Therefore, this method has been proved in both simulation and experiment to significantly improve the reconstruction when the source bandwidth, illumination size and scan step size increase. It is worth mentioning that the accurate and detailed information of the energy spectrum for the incident beam is not required in advance for the proposed method. Further, we combine multi-wavelength and mixed-state approaches to jointly solve temporal and spatial partial coherence in ptychography so that it can handle various disadvantageous experimental effects. The significant relaxation in coherence requirements by our approaches allows the use of high-flux broadband X-ray sources for high-efficient and high-resolution ptychographic imaging.},

The system consists of a PLD chamber mounted on a diffractometer allowing both real-time surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and in situ hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). HAXPES is performed in the incident X-ray energy range from 4 to 12 keV using a Scienta EW4000 electron energy analyzer mounted on the PLD chamber fixed parallel with the surface normal. In addition to the standard application mode of HAXPES for disentangling surface from bulk properties, the increased penetration depth of high energy photoelectrons is used for investigation of the electronic structure changes through thin films grown deliberately as variable thickness capping layers. Such heterostructures represent model systems for investigating a variety of critical thickness and dead layer phenomena observed at complex oxide interfaces. In this new mode of operation, in situ HAXPES is used to determine the electronic structure associated with unique structural features identified by real-time SXRD during thin film growth. The system is configured for using both laboratory excitation sources off-line and on-line operation at beamline 33-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source. We illustrate the performance of the system by preliminary scattering and spectroscopic data on oxygen vacancy ordering induced perovskite-to-brownmillerite reversible phase transformation in La2/3Sr1/3MnO$_3$ films capped with oxygen deficient SrTiO$_3$-$\delta$ (100) layers of varying thickness.},

We demonstrate an x-ray-diffraction-based characterization method that uses high-energy photons (85 kiloelectron volts) to provide unexpected gains in data acquisition speed by several orders of magnitude and enables structural determinations of surfaces on time scales suitable for in situ studies. We illustrate the potential of high-energy surface x-ray diffraction by determining the structure of a palladium surface in situ during catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation and follow dynamic restructuring of the surface with subsecond time resolution.},

   abstract = {Catalysts are materials that accelerate the rate of a desired chemical reaction. As such, they constitute an integral part in many applications ranging from the production of fine chemicals in chemical industry to exhaust gas treatment in vehicles. Accordingly, it is of utmost economic interest to improve catalyst efficiency and performance, which requires an understanding of the interplay between the catalyst structure, the gas phase and the catalytic activity under realistic reaction conditions at ambient pressures and elevated temperatures. In recent years efforts have been made to increasingly develop techniques that allow for investigating model catalyst samples under conditions closer to those of real technical catalysts. One of these techniques is high energy surface x-ray diffraction (HESXRD), which uses x-rays with photon energies typically in the range of 70-80 keV. HESXRD allows a fast data collection of three dimensional reciprocal space for the structure determination of model catalyst samples under operando conditions and has since been used for the investigation of an increasing number of different model catalysts. In this article we will review general considerations of HESXRD including its working principle for different model catalyst samples and the experimental equipment required. An overview over HESXRD investigations performed in recent years will be given, and the advantages of HESXRD with respect to its application to different model catalyst samples will be presented. Moreover, the combination of HESXRD with other operando techniques such as in situ mass spectrometry, planar laser-induced fluorescence and surface optical reflectance will be discussed. The article will close with an outlook on future perspectives and applications of HESXRD.},

This allows for fast acquisition and processing of high-resolution data sets and results in a significant reduction of the size of the data set. The subsequent analysis then proceeds in reciprocal space. It has evolved from the specific needs of the ID03 beamline at the ESRF, but it has a modular design and can be easily adjusted and extended to work with data from other beamlines or from other measurement techniques.

Herein, we provide a study of the surface/subsurface of ceria–soot and ceria–zirconia–soot mixtures under working conditions by means of near-ambient-pressure photoelectron spectroscopy. Soot abatement involves two cooperative routes: one occurring at the ceria–soot interface with formation of oxygen vacancies and CeIII and the other at the surface of soot, mediated by active superoxide species, which result from the reaction between gas-phase O$_2$ and oxygen vacancies. The two routes occur simultaneously and mutually reinforce each other.},

The raw image captured at the detector plane is then predominantly a Poisson random process with Gaussian noise added due to the quantum nature of photo-electric conversion. Under such noisy conditions, highly ill-posed problems such as phase retrieval from raw intensity measurements become prone to strong artifacts in the reconstructions; a situation that deep neural networks (DNNs) have already been shown to be useful at improving. Here, we demonstrate that random phase modulation on the optical field, also known as coherent modulation imaging (CMI), in conjunction with the phase extraction neural network (PhENN) and a Gerchberg-Saxton-Fienup (GSF) approximant, further improves resilience to noise of the phase-from-intensity imaging problem.

Yau et al. heated gold thin films and used coherent x-ray diffractive imaging to track how these microstructures developed during grain growth (see the Perspective by Suter). The technique allowed nondestructive visualization of the features in three dimensions. The method should help link external stimuli to material response through changes in microstructure, thereby allowing development of novel materials through microstructural engineering. Science, this issue p. 739; see also p. 704 Bragg coherent diffractive imaging can track defects and grain boundaries during heating in a gold thin film. Polycrystalline material properties depend on the distribution and interactions of their crystalline grains. In particular, grain boundaries and defects are crucial in determining their response to external stimuli. A long-standing challenge is thus to observe individual grains, defects, and strain dynamics inside functional materials. Here we report a technique capable of revealing grain heterogeneity, including strain fields and individual dislocations, that can be used under operando conditions in reactive environments: grain Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (gBCDI). Using a polycrystalline gold thin film subjected to heating, we show how gBCDI resolves grain boundary and dislocation dynamics in individual grains in three-dimensional detail with 10-nanometer spatial and subangstrom displacement field resolution. These results pave the way for understanding polycrystalline material response under external stimuli and, ideally, engineering particular functions.}

We show that defective Pd nanoparticles exhibit sloped isotherms, indicating that defects act as additional barriers to the phase transformation.

The experiment was performed at a temperature of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixtures. The nanoparticle was preselected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and postanalyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as determined by CXDI and AFM. In addition, we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region. We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred. New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk. Our high-resolution experiments pave the way for future CXDI experiments under operando catalytic reaction conditions.},

abstract = {The upgraded ID01 beamline now offers a coherent X-ray probe, 56nm×141nm in size (full width half maximum), combined with access to large swathes of reciprocal space with an area detector and sufficient working distance to host various sample environments. Coherent diffraction imaging at Bragg reflections offers picometre sensitivity to lattice distortions in crystals and access to the full strain tensor, in the case where three or more non-coplanar reflections are measured. Defects may have a strong effect on the physical properties of materials. As the majority of defects produce lattice distortions, hence these can be imaged. Here we describe the instrumentation at ID01 required to produce such foci and the protocols employed to ensure reliable data acquisition. The wavefront of the incident beam must be coherent in order to observe interference. Thus the coherent probe is recovered online via ptychography on a reference structure at the beginning of every experiment, and can be executed at any time to confirm beam quality and maintain experimental consistency. Due to the small source size in the vertical direction a diffraction limited spot is achieved, whereas in the horizontal the beam size is defined by the image of the source. With the upgrade of the ESRF this asymmetry is supposed to decrease substantially, and will be accompanied by an increase in coherent flux density by a factor of 30–100.},

Researchers have begun to tell a more complete story of catalysis from a perspective which brings this concept to the forefront of the discussion. The nano-'realm' makes the effects of surface lattice strain, which acts on the same spatial scales, more pronounced due to a higher ratio of surface to bulk atoms. This is especially evident in the field of metal nanoparticle catalysis, where displacement of atoms on surfaces can significantly alter the sorption properties of molecules. In part, the concept of strain-engineering for catalysis opened up due to the achievements that were made in the synthesis of a more sophisticated nanoparticle library from an ever-expanding set of methodologies. Developing synthesis methods for metal nanoparticles with well-defined and strained architectures is a worthy goal that, if reached, will have considerable impact in the search for catalysts. In this review, we summarize the recent accomplishments in the area of surface lattice-strained metal nanoparticle synthesis, framing the discussion from the important perspective of surface lattice strain effects in catalysis.},

Recovering images from raw ptychographic data, however, requires the solution of an inverse problem, namely, phase retrieval. Phase retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive, which precludes real-time imaging. In this work, we propose PtychoNN, an approach to solve the ptychography data inversion problem based on a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. Our results demonstrate the practical application of machine learning to recover high fidelity amplitude and phase contrast images of a real sample hundreds of times faster than current ptychography reconstruction packages. Furthermore, by overcoming the constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax sampling constraints on data acquisition while still producing an excellent image of the sample. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability has profound implications for the imaging of dose sensitive, dynamic, and extremely voluminous samples.},

The nine best practices for instilling scientific integrity in the implementation of these two overarching principles are (1) Require universal training in robust scientific methods, in the use of appropriate experimental design and statistics, and in responsible research practices for scientists at all levels, with the training content regularly updated and presented by qualified scientists. (2) Strengthen scientific integrity oversight and processes throughout the research continuum with a focus on training in ethics and conduct. (3) Encourage reproducibility of research through transparency. (4) Strive to establish open science as the standard operating procedure throughout the scientific enterprise. (5) Develop and implement educational tools to teach communication skills that uphold scientific integrity. (6) Strive to identify ways to further strengthen the peer review process. (7) Encourage scientific journals to publish unanticipated findings that meet standards of quality and scientific integrity.

The X-ray results on the particle morphology were complemented by transmission electron microscopy studies. The samples were prepared by means of physical vapor deposition and differed in average particle size and lateral particle size distribution. The oxygen-induced particle shape changes were found to be independent of particle size and were characterized by the emergence of higher indexed facets. We find the bulk oxide formation to be kinetically hindered and particle size-dependent. The formed bulk oxide structures were concluded to be (110)-oriented Pt$_3$O$_4$ and a modified structure of (0001)-oriented $\alpha$-PtO$_2$.CO exposure of the oxidized particles did not lead to a shape change reversibility.},

Multiple locations of the sample are simultaneously imaged by spatially separated X-ray beams, therefore, the obtained field-of-view in one scan can be enlarged by a factor equal to the number of illuminations. We have demonstrated this technique experimentally using two X-ray beams focused by a house-made Fresnel zone plate array. Two areas of the object and corresponding double illuminations were successfully reconstructed from diffraction patterns acquired in one scan, with image quality similar with those obtained by conventional single-beam ptychography in sequence.

abstract = {Au/CeO$_2$ (0.25% wt. Au) catalysts were prepared by anchoring preformed Au nanoparticles over ceria polycrystals, cubes and rods and tested in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx. The use of preformed Au nanoparticles assured a constant Au particle size (ca. 5 nm by HRTEM) for all samples, which allowed to a precise assessment of the effect of the morphology of nanoshaped ceria on catalytic activity. The catalytic performance of the Au/CeO$_2$-rods was much better than that of the Au/CeO$_2$-polycrystals and Au/CeO$_2$-cubes both in the oxidation of CO and COPrOx reactions. The Au/CeO$_2$-rods exhibited the highest amount of oxidized Au and Ce(III) species by XPS, whereas in the Au/CeO$_2$-cubes gold was totally metallic and the amount of Ce(III) was minimum. An intermediate situation was encountered in the Au/CeO$_2$-polycrystals. Considering the differences in the oxidation states of Au and Ce and the fact that all samples were prepared with preformed metallic Au nanoparticles of the same size, the results indicate that the intrinsic nature of the different ceria surfaces exerts a prominent role in the gold-ceria interaction and in the electron density transfer from Au to Ce, which in turn has a strong effect on catalytic activity. Gold nanoparticles strongly interact with CeO$_2$-{1 1 0} surfaces with respect to CeO$_2$-{1 1 1} and CeO$_2$-{1 0 0}, even when Au nanoparticles are prepared separately and simply deposited by impregnation.},

Nanocrystals of Au of 3--5{\thinspace}nm in diameter were studied by examining diffraction intensity oscillations around the Bragg peaks. Both results obtained from modelling the experimental data and molecular dynamics simulations strongly suggest inhomogeneous relaxations, involving large out-of-plane bond length contractions for the edge atoms (∼0.2{\thinspace}{\AA}); a significant contraction (∼0.13{\thinspace}{\AA}) for {\{}100{\}} surface atoms; and a much smaller contraction (∼0.05{\thinspace}{\AA}) for atoms in the middle of the {\{}111{\}} facets.

abstract = {Using a signal-to-noise ratio estimation based on correlations between multiple simulated images, we compare the dose efficiency of two soft x-ray imaging systems: incoherent brightfield imaging using zone plate optics in a transmission x-ray microscope (TXM), and x-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) where an image is reconstructed from the far-field coherent diffraction pattern. In XDM one must computationally phase weak diffraction signals; in TXM one suffers signal losses due to the finite numerical aperture and efficiency of the optics. In simulations with objects representing isolated cells such as yeast, we find that XDM has the potential for delivering equivalent resolution images using fewer photons. This can be an important advantage for studying radiation-sensitive biological and soft matter specimens. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America},

abstract = {Bragg coherent diffraction imaging has the potential to provide significant insight into the structure-properties relationship for crystalline materials by imaging, with nanoscale resolution, three-dimensional strain fields within individual grains and nanoparticles. The capability of present-day synchrotrons to locate and measure a multiplicity of Bragg reflections from a single grain makes it possible to recover the full strain tensor with nanometer resolution. Recent methods for coupling reconstructions from several peaks to determine the strain tensor have been developed and applied to synthetic data, but have not been applied to experimental data. Here, using a coupled genetic reconstruction algorithm, we reconstruct an experimental data set and demonstrate improvements in the ability to resolve vector-valued displacement fields internal to the particle as compared to what is achieved with a noncoupled approach. The coupled approach developed in this work was also validated on simulated data sets. In both simulated and experimental data, reconstructions from our coupled Bragg peak algorithm show improvements over the noncoupled independent reconstruction method of 5% in terms of accuracy and 53% in terms of consistency.},

We find that the reactivity of the O/Pt(111) system decreases monotonically with increasing oxygen coverage. Of the three surface oxygen phases, viz., chemisorbed oxygen (Oad), a PtO-like surface oxide, and α-PtO$_2$ trilayers, Oad exhibits the highest reactivity toward CO, whereas α-PtO$_2$ trilayers exhibit the lowest. Pt(111) surfaces fully terminated by α-PtO$_2$ trilayers are inert to CO.

abstract = {Measurement modalities in Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) rely on finding a signal from a single nanoscale crystal object which satisfies the Bragg condition among a large number of arbitrarily oriented nanocrystals. However, even when the signal from a single Bragg reflection with ({\it hkl}) Miller indices is found, the crystallographic axes on the retrieved three-dimensional (3D) image of the crystal remain unknown, and thus localizing in reciprocal space other Bragg reflections becomes time-consuming or requires good knowledge of the orientation of the crystal. Here, the commissioning of a movable double-bounce Si (111) monochromator at the 34-ID-C endstation of the Advanced Photon Source is reported, which aims at delivering multi-reflection BCDI as a standard tool in a single beamline instrument. The new instrument enables, through rapid~switching from monochromatic to broadband (pink) beam, the use of Laue~diffraction to determine crystal orientation. With a proper orientation matrix~determined for the lattice, one can measure coherent diffraction patterns near multiple Bragg peaks, thus providing sufficient information to image the full strain tensor in 3D. The design, concept of operation, the developed procedures for indexing Laue patterns, and automated measuring of Bragg coherent diffraction data from multiple reflections of the same nanocrystal are discussed.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanism of CO$_2$ hydrogenation on a Ni(111) surface has been thoroughly investigated by means of periodic density functional theory calculations, including dispersion interactions, along with accurate kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, including lateral interactions between the adsorbates. The present reaction model involves 25 different species and a total of 86 elementary processes, including adsorptions, desorptions, surface chemical steps, and diffusions. The reaction network accounts for three different mechanisms for the reverse water-gas shift reaction and three different mechanisms for methanation. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the reverse water-gas shift reaction dominates the CO$_2$ hydrogenation on Ni(111) with no evidence of methane formation. The reaction proceeds mainly through the redox route, with the carboxyl pathway also being active but to a lesser extent. Methane production is hindered by the H + CO → HCO endothermicity and the prohibitive energy barrier for CO dissociation, implying CO desorption rather than evolution through the Sabatier reaction. A detailed comparison to earlier theoretical studies supporting the methanation reaction shows that some unreliable assumptions along with limited theoretical approaches biased the former conclusion.},

Recent advances have enabled atomic force microscopy to study single dislocations in two dimensions, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can now visualize strain fields in three dimensions with near-atomic resolution. However, these techniques cannot offer three-dimensional imaging of the formation or movement of dislocations during dynamic processes. Here, we describe how Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI; refs,) can be used to visualize in three dimensions, the entire network of dislocations present within an individual calcite crystal during repeated growth and dissolution cycles.

The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-CDI-NN, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programing framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain, solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be “physics-aware” in multiple aspects; in that the physics of the X-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-CDI-NN can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods. Our integrated machine learning and differential programing solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.}",

Exposure to reactants can cause entirely new structures to form at the catalyst surface, and these may dramatically influence the reaction by `poisoning' it or by acting as the catalytically active phase. For example, thin metal oxide films have been identified as highly active structures that form spontaneously on metal surfaces during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during this reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active palladium oxide film. We show that stabilization of the metal, caused by the steps and consequent destabilization of the oxide, is at the heart of the well-known reaction rate oscillations exhibited during CO oxidation at atmospheric pressure.},

Calle-Vallejo et al. describe a simpler metric for assessing optimal reactivity: a weighted average of surface coordination that includes second-nearest neighbors (see the Perspective by Stephens et al.). The calculations identified three approaches for introducing cavity sites into the platinum(111) surface to improve its performance for the oxygen reduction reaction used in fuel cells. Science, this issue p. 185, see also p. 164 Detailed comparison of exposed atom coordination can guide the design of a metal surface for heterogeneous catalysis. [Also see Perspective by Stephens et al.] A good heterogeneous catalyst for a given chemical reaction very often has only one specific type of surface site that is catalytically active. Widespread methodologies such as Sabatier-type activity plots determine optimal adsorption energies to maximize catalytic activity, but these are difficult to use as guidelines to devise new catalysts. We introduce “coordination-activity plots” that predict the geometric structure of optimal active sites. The method is illustrated on the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by platinum. Sites with the same number of first-nearest neighbors as (111) terraces but with an increased number of second-nearest neighbors are predicted to have superior catalytic activity. We used this rationale to create highly active sites on platinum (111), without alloying and using three different affordable experimental methods.}

In the substitution of fossil-fuels by renewable energy resources, nanometer-sized particles play a key role for synthesizing energy vectors from varying and heterogeneous biomass feedstocks. They are extensively used in reformers for the production of hydrogen from solid, liquid, or gaseous energy carriers. Catalyst activities depend critically on their size-dependent properties. Nanoparticles are further indispensable as electrocatalysts in fuel cells and other electrochemical converters. The desire to increase the activity per unit area, and decrease the necessary amount of the expensive catalytic standard, platinum, has spurred innovative approaches for the synthesis of platinum-alloy nanoparticles by wet chemistry, colloidal routes, or physical techniques such as sputtering.},

Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging, we determined the structure of the mesocrystal with the resolution sufficient to resolve each gold nanoparticle. The reconstructed electron density of the gold mesocrystal reveals its intrinsic structural heterogeneity, including local deviations of lattice parameters, and the presence of internal defects. The strain distribution shows that the average superlattice obtained by angular X-ray cross-correlation analysis and the real, "multidomain"structure of a mesocrystal are very close to each other, with a deviation less than 10\%.

Effective analysis of reported data using machine learning (ML) methods offers the ability to gain valuable information. However, utilizing the literature in this way has obstacles such as lack of compositional overlaps, bias from prior published data, and low sample counts for many elements. The present study describes an ML approach that considers elemental features as input representations instead of inputting catalyst compositions directly. This ML method has the potential for catalyst discovery, including catalytic reactions with limited catalyst composition overlap in the available data. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), water gas shift (WGS), and CO oxidation reactions were chosen to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by analysis using several state-of-the-art ML methods. Among the ML methods tested, gradient boosting regression with XGBoost (XGB) provided the best results, and prediction accuracy was improved by the proposed approach for all three reaction types. In addition, a quantitative value of “feature importance score” was calculated to evaluate the most influential input variables on catalyst performance. Finally, catalyst optimization was explored using ML as a “surrogate” model, and the top 20 promising candidate catalysts were identified for the OCM reaction based on the optimization. The advantages of ML in catalysis analysis as well as the difficulties and limitations originating from the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis were explored.},

abstract={Catalysis is at the core of chemistry and has been essential to make all the goods surrounding us, including fuels, coatings, plastics and other functional materials. In the near future, catalysis will also be an essential tool in making the shift from a fossil-fuel-based to a more renewable and circular society. To make this reality, we have to better understand the fundamental concept of the active site in catalysis. Here, we discuss the physical meaning --- and deduce the validity and, therefore, usefulness --- of some common approaches in heterogeneous catalysis, such as linking catalyst activity to a `turnover frequency' and explaining catalytic performance in terms of `structure sensitivity' or `structure insensitivity'. Catalytic concepts from the fields of enzymatic and homogeneous catalysis are compared, ultimately realizing that the struggle that one encounters in defining the active site in most solid catalysts is likely the one we must overcome to reach our end goal: tailoring the precise functioning of the active sites with respect to many different parameters to satisfy our ever-growing needs. This article ends with an outlook of what may become feasible within the not-too-distant future with modern experimental and theoretical tools at hand.},

   abstract = {The preferential oxidation of CO in H$_2$-rich mixtures (COPrOx) is a major catalytic reaction utilized for hydrogen purification. In the exploration of alternatives to noble metals, cobalt-based catalysts appear to be a very promising choice. The activity and stability of cobalt in the COPrOx reaction can be improved by the addition of transition metals and manganese is maybe the most prominent among them. Yet, the arrangement of the two components in the catalytically active state is largely unknown, which hinders in-depth understanding of the manganese promotion effect. Here, we compare pure and Mn-modified cobalt catalysts and correlate their structural and chemical characteristics with their COPrOx performance. The Mn-promoted cobalt catalyst is significantly more active than pure cobalt especially at intermediate reaction temperatures (around 200 °C). The addition of Mn improves the structural stability of the catalyst and helps to maintain higher specific surface areas. Chemical and microstructural analysis using various operando and in situ techniques revealed that Mn promotes CO conversion by partially stabilizing CoO phase during reaction conditions. It is also suggested that at high temperature, Mn suppress CO methanation reaction but promotes H$_2$ oxidation. Apart of the particular interest in COPrOx reaction, in a general context, this work shows how the spatial distribution of the different catalyst components at nanoscopic level, may affect the surface chemistry and consequently control the reactivity.},

In the past, discoveries have often followed events such as wars or embargos, whereas the current driving forces of studies, researches and then discoveries aim at a better understanding of catalytic processes, at reducing the costs of raw materials and processes, at developing new catalytic materials and at addressing environmental issues. This review focuses on the history of many catalytic industrial processes, environmental issues, catalytic materials, especially their expected catalytic properties, on catalyst characterisation by physical methods and development of in situ conditions, i.e., characterisation under actual working conditions with reactants and products analyzed on-line. Emphasis is also placed on high selectivity in catalytic reactions and the major challenges for the future, such as environmental issues, energy supply, pollution control for vehicles and industrial plants, air/VOCs/water purification, hydrogen sources and carbon dioxide storage/up grading, transformation of biomass as a promising source of raw materials, and catalytic water splitting perspectives. This review is a survey of heterogeneous catalysis and is not comprehensive but leads to the conclusion that, although many catalysts and catalytic processes have already been discovered and developed over the past century, many opportunities nevertheless exist for new developments, new processes and new catalytic materials. It follows that substantial challenges exist for the younger generation of researchers and engineers, as emphasized at the end of the manuscript.}

They are calculated within the tight-binding approximation using a moment method and a continued fraction analysis. The d band degeneracy and the charge rearrangement occurring near the surface when cleaving the crystal are fully taken into account by computing exactly a large number of moments (22–26). The surface LDS are found to be strongly dependent on the cleavage plane. Indeed, whereas the LDS on dense planes are rather bulk like, sharp peaks arising from states localized near the surface are obtained near the atomic level of the metal on non-dense planes of cleavage. In addition, the bandwidth is broadened by surface states for Ni. On the contrary, for bcc Fe the surface potential is not strong enough to modify the bandwidth. A comparison is made with spectroscopic observations. The method lends itself to other interesting applications in the surface physics field and, as an example, we present the results of calculations of the spatial distribution of the electronic charge near the surface and its deviation from spherical symmetry. The charge asphericity is slightly increased when going from a bulk to a surface site as the difference between the occupations of two surface orbitals can reach 0.34 ē instead of 0.15 -c for a bulk site. Diagrams are shown for (100) and (110) cleaved Ni to illustrate the results. The consequences upon preferred adsorption sites according to the electronic affinity and size of the adsorbate are discussed.}

abstract={In 2016, it was 100 years ago that Langmuir formulated the famous Langmuir equation $\theta${\thinspace}={\thinspace}KP/(1{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}KP) for the adsorption of molecules on surfaces, which is used in the description of catalytic reactions between two chemisorbed molecules. Also in 2016, it was 75 years ago that Eley and Rideal studied the mechanism of the reaction between a chemisorbed molecule and a physisorbed molecule. However, they studied a very special case of adsorption, whereas the more general interaction of a chemisorbed molecule and a molecule colliding with it from the gas phase had already been proposed by Langmuir in addition to the reaction between two chemisorbed molecules. Therefore, the reaction between a chemisorbed molecule and a gaseous colliding molecule should be called Langmuir--Rideal reaction rather than Eley--Rideal reaction, as it is often called in surface science, catalysis and astronomy. The mechanism that Eley and Rideal really studied some 75 years ago is important in heterogeneous as well as homogeneous catalysis in the liquid-phase and is related to outer-sphere reactions.},

abstract={Supported metal nanoparticles, M-NPs, are of great scientific and economic interest as they encompass application in chemical manufacturing, oil refining and environmental catalysis. Oxidation and hydrogenation reactions are among the major reactions catalyzed by supported M-NPs. Although supported M-NPs are preferable due to their easy recovery and reuse, there are still some practical issues regarding their catalytic activity and deactivation. This review highlights the general features of supported M-NPs as catalysts with particular attention to copper, gold, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, silver, cobalt and nickel and their catalytic evaluation in various reactions. The catalytic performance of noble M-NPs has been explored extensively in various selective oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. In general, noble metals are expensive and sensitive to poisons. Despite their significant merits and potential (easily available, comparatively inexpensive and less sensitive to poisons), catalysis by base M-NPs is relatively less explored. Therefore, activity of base M-NPs can be improved, and still, there is potential for such catalysts.},

This field, “semi-heterogeneous catalysis”, is at the frontier between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, and progress has been made in the efficiency and selectivity of reactions and recovery and recyclability of the catalytic materials. Usually NP catalysts are prepared from a metal salt, a reducing agent, and a stabilizer and are supported on an oxide, charcoal, or a zeolite. Besides the polymers and oxides that used to be employed as standard, innovative stabilizers, media, and supports have appeared, such as dendrimers, specific ligands, ionic liquids, surfactants, membranes, carbon nanotubes, and a variety of oxides. Ligand-free procedures have provided remarkable results with extremely low metal loading. The Review presents the recent developments and the use of NP catalysis in organic synthesis, for example, in hydrogenation and CC coupling reactions, and the heterogeneous oxidation of CO on gold NPs.},

abstract={The surface composition of Rh and Pt blacks (as determined by XPS) shows carbon and oxygen impurities in the untreated state. Oxygen on Pt is present as adsorbed O as well as OH/H$_2$O groups and oxidized carbon. Rh was partly oxidized to Rh2O3, in agreement with UPS showing hardly any Fermi‐edge intensity in untreated Rh as opposed to untreated Pt. High Fermi‐edge intensities indicated a predominant metallic surface after an in situ treatment with H$_2$ at 483 K, increasing the purity (XPS) to ∼90{\%}. This treatment reduced Rh to metal and removed its C impurity. Pt, in turn, retained much carbon after H$_2$ treatment, present mainly as graphitic carbon. A minor amount of CO was also detected, some of the O 1s peak belonging to it. The two metals were tested in methylcyclopentane reactions. Considering the necessity of carbon for nondegradative reactions and oxygen enhancing fragmentation, a correlation is suggested between the typical impurities of Pt and Rh and their respective catalytic propensities: the high fragmentation activity of Rh and the predominant nondegradative reactions to C6 ``ring opening products'' on Pt.},

NO was found to be the main reaction intermediate yielding N$_2$O as well as N$_2$. NO could be formed even at room temperature and when oxidized to NOx became adsorbed to the silver surface, thus blocking the active sites for oxygen dissociation. The dissociation of oxygen is thus believed to be the rate-controlling step for ammonia oxidation. The selectivity for N$_2$, N$_2$O, and NO is mainly determined by the surface oxygen coverage and by reaction temperature. The adsorbed NOx and N2Ox species are actually inhibitors for ammonia oxidation but these adsorbed species lower the surface oxygen coverage. Hence the selectivity for nitrogen is improved with increasing amounts of these adsorbed species.}

Research into shape-controlled NCs have shown that the catalytic properties of a material are sensitive not only to the size but also to the shape of the NCs as a consequence of well-defined facets. These findings are of great importance for modern heterogeneous catalysis research. First, a rational synthesis of catalysts might be achieved, since desired activity and selectivity would be acquired by simply tuning the shape, that is, the exposed crystal facets, of a NC catalyst. Second, shape-controlled NCs are relatively simple systems, in contrast to traditional complex solids, suggesting that they may serve as novel model catalysts to bridge the gap between model surfaces and real catalysts.},

So far, however, such relationships were difficult to determine for catalysts consisting of supported nanoparticles. Here, we employ a nanoreactor to study the oscillatory CO oxidation catalysed by Pt nanoparticles using time-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and calorimetry. The observations reveal that periodic changes in the CO oxidation are synchronous with a periodic refacetting of the Pt nanoparticles. The oscillatory reaction is modelled using density functional theory and mass transport calculations, considering the CO adsorption energy and the oxidation rate as site-dependent. We find that to successfully explain the oscillations, the model must contain the phenomenon of refacetting. The nanoreactor approach can thus provide atomic-scale information that is specific to surface sites. This will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {After a brief introduction on his youth and education, the paper concentrates on the origin and importance of the work of Paul Sabatier (1856–1941). After his “docteur ès sciences” thesis on sulphides in 1880 under the guidance of Marcellin Berthelot at Collège de France in Paris, and a very short stay at the University of Bordeaux to teach physics, he became Professor of Chemistry at the University of Toulouse from 1884 until he retired in 1930. Sabatier worked on different subjects (noteworthy is his book on agricultural chemistry) before concentrating on the subject which earned him the celebrity. The publications of Mond et al. (action of carbon monoxide on nickel) and of Moissan and Moureu (action of acetylene on nickel) are at the origin of the work of Sabatier and Senderens who discovered the method of direct hydrogenation of organic molecules on finely disintegrated nickel. The paper raises the question as to why the Nobel Committee did not use the word catalysis in the nomination concerning Sabatier. As a matter of fact, Sabatier not only used catalysts but also proposed the first chemical theory of catalysis based “on the temporary formation of unstable chemical compounds which, serving as intermediate steps in the reaction, determine its direction or increase its velocity”. Among all the physical and chemical theories of catalysis proposed so far, that of Sabatier has undergone the test of time with success and still continues to be fertile. Paul Sabatier leaves a considerable legacy, not only locally (he is at the origin of three Schools of the Institut National Polytechnique of Toulouse) but also internationally (major contribution to the development of agricultural chemistry and industrial catalysis) and beyond, notably with the so-called “Sabatier” reaction (CO$_2$+4H2→CH4+2H$_2$O) currently used in the International Space Station to produce the water necessary onboard.}

abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

abstract = {The X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) technique assumes that the structure factor holds constant over the measured crystal. This approximation breaks down for materials exhibiting variations in the unit-cell configuration, such as piezo- and ferroelectrics. In that case, the strain field cannot be reliably determined from the reconstruction because the lattice deformation and the structure factor contribute concomitantly. Proposed here is a solution to this problem achieved by combining Bragg CDI and the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction approach that measures a Friedel pair of reflections at two different photon energies near an absorption edge. Comparing the obtained reconstructions with a parametric model that includes calculating the scattering amplitude as a function of wavelength and the unit-cell configuration, the contributions of the lattice deformation and the structure factor are separated. Simulations of the ferroelectric material BaTiO$_3$ demonstrate the possibility of simultaneous probing of the strain and displacement of the Ti atoms. The proposed method opens up an opportunity to apply coherent X-ray diffraction for nanoscale-resolved 3D mapping of polarization domains in micro- and nanocrystals.},

The ability to predict the structural evolution of catalytic nanocrystals during the reaction is of primary importance for catalyst design. However, to date, imaging and characterising the structure of defects inside a nanocrystal in three-dimensions and in situ during reaction has remained a challenge. We report here an unusual twin boundary migration process in a single platinum nanoparticle during CO oxidation using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging as the characterisation tool. Density functional theory calculations show that twin migration can be correlated with the relative change in the interfacial energies of the free surfaces exposed to CO. The x-ray technique also reveals particle reshaping during the reaction. In situ and non-invasive structural characterisation of defects during reaction opens new avenues for understanding defect behaviour in confined crystals and paves the way for strain and defect engineering.},

The inhomogeneous distribution of the cations affects their catalytic performances because it influences the intra-crystalline diffusion rates of the reactants and products. However, the structural deformation regarding inhomogeneous active regions during the catalysis is not yet observed by conventional analytical tools. Here we employ in situ X-ray free electron laser-based time-resolved coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to investigate the internal deformations originating from the inhomogeneous Cu ion distributions in Cu-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite crystals during the deoxygenation of nitrogen oxides with propene. We show that the interactions between the reactants and the active sites lead to an unusual strain distribution, confirmed by density functional theory simulations. These observations provide insights into the role of structural inhomogeneity in zeolites during catalysis and will assist the future design of zeolites for their applications.},

A challenge, particularly for new users of the technique, is accurate mapping of experimental data, collected in the detector reciprocal space coordinate frame, to more convenient orthogonal coordinates, {\it e.g.} attached to the sample. This is particularly the case since different coordinate conventions are used at every BCDI beamline. The reconstruction algorithms and mapping scripts composed for individual beamlines are not readily interchangeable. To overcome this, a BCDI experiment simulation with a plugin script that converts all beamline angles to a universal, right-handed coordinate frame is introduced, making it possible to condense any beamline geometry into three rotation matrices. The simulation translates a user-specified 3D complex object to different BCDI-related coordinate frames. It also allows the generation of synthetic coherent diffraction data that can be inserted into any BCDI reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the original user-specified object. Scripts are provided to map from sample space to detector conjugated space, detector conjugated space to sample space and detector conjugated space to detector conjugated space for a different reflection. This provides the reader with the basis for a flexible simulation tool kit that is easily adapted to different geometries. It is anticipated that this will find use in the generation of tailor-made supports for phasing of challenging data and exploration of novel geometries or data collection modalities.},

Reduced pure Pt (Pt100) gauze shows a slightly higher initial activity (after 10min on stream) in the reaction than reduced pure Rh (Rh100) wire. The initial N$_2$O conversion over various Pt–Rh alloys (95–5, 90–10, and 80–20) was considerably lower than that of the pure metals. The following order of initial activity was obtained: Pt100>Rh100>Pt95–Rh5>Pt90–Rh10>Pt80–Rh20. However, Pt100 gauze rapidly deactivates with time-on-stream. This deactivation is tentatively attributed to the penetration of oxygen (generated upon N$_2$O decomposition) into the bulk of the metal. In contrast to Pt100 gauze, Rh100 wire activates with time-on-stream leading to a significantly enhanced and stable N$_2$O conversion. The activity trend after 900min on stream is changed to: Rh100>Pt95–Rh5>Pt90–Rh10>Pt80–Rh20>Pt100. The different catalytic performance of Rh is related to the gradual transformation of metallic Rh to Rh2O3 under reaction conditions as concluded from surface composition obtained by XPS analyses. Our results indicate that the Pt–Rh alloy gauzes are inactive for direct N$_2$O decomposition in the presence of excess oxygen, as typically found in ammonia burners.}

The coverage and temperature-dependent bonding configurations of NO have been identified from adsorbate O 1s and substrate Pt 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra, which were collected in situ during NO uptake or heating with data collection times per spectrum between 4 and 7 s. At 110 K, NO molecularly adsorbs on Pt(1 1 1) and sequentially populates three different adsorption sites. Up to coverages of 0.25 ML, only fcc-hollow sites are occupied, leading to the formation of a (2 × 2)-NO adsorbate structure. As coverage increases, in addition on-top sites are populated until at 0.5 ML a (2 × 2)-2NO structure is formed, which also represents the saturation structure at 250 K. Further increasing the coverage at 110 K leads to the occupation of hcp-hollow sites; at saturation, a (2 × 2)-3NO structure is observed with a coverage of 0.75 ML. Upon heating, the desorption of NO from the hcp-hollow sites gives rise to a desorption peak at 190 K. Further heating induces the desorption of on-top NO species starting at 275 K and fcc-hollow NO species starting at 320 K. No dissociation takes place. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Within this context, scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy has become a routine technique, giving access to structural properties with sub-micrometre resolution. This article presents an optimized technique and an associated software package which have been implemented at the ID01 beamline (ESRF, Grenoble). A structural scanning probe microscope with intriguing imaging qualities is obtained. The technique consists in a two-dimensional quick continuous mapping with sub-micrometre resolution of a sample at a given reciprocal space position. These real space maps are made by continuously moving the sample while recording scattering images with a fast two-dimensional detector for every point along a rocking curve. Five-dimensional data sets are then produced, consisting of millions of detector images. The images are processed by the user-friendly X-ray strain orientation calculation software ({\it XSOCS}), which has been developed at ID01 for automatic analysis. It separates tilt and strain and generates two-dimensional maps of these parameters. At spatial resolutions of typically 200{--}800nm, this quick imaging technique achieves strain sensitivity below {$\Delta$}{\it a}/{\it a} = 10${\sp {$-$}5}$ and a resolution of tilt variations down to 10${\sp {$-$}3}${$^\circ$} over a field of view of 100 {$\times$} 100{$\mu$}m.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles have found many applications in modern technology; however, the full characterization of individual particles is challenging. One of the most interesting mechanical properties is the particle's response to lattice distortion. This property has been probed for ensembles of nanoparticles, but the required averaging may distort the results. Clark et al. (p. 56, published online 23 May; see the Perspective by Hartland and Lo) were able to image the generation and subsequent evolution of coherent acoustic phonons from an individual perturbed gold nanocrystal on the picosecond time scale. An x-ray free-electron laser is used to probe the elastic modes of a gold nanocrystal. [Also see Perspective by Hartland and Lo] Key insights into the behavior of materials can be gained by observing their structure as they undergo lattice distortion. Laser pulses on the femtosecond time scale can be used to induce disorder in a “pump-probe” experiment with the ensuing transients being probed stroboscopically with femtosecond pulses of visible light, x-rays, or electrons. Here we report three-dimensional imaging of the generation and subsequent evolution of coherent acoustic phonons on the picosecond time scale within a single gold nanocrystal by means of an x-ray free-electron laser, providing insights into the physics of this phenomenon. Our results allow comparison and confirmation of predictive models based on continuum elasticity theory and molecular dynamics simulations.}

abstract = {In order to fully benefit from a beam produced by modern synchrotron light sources, characterised by a wide and continuous energy spectrum, high brightness and a very high intensity, advancement in detector technology has been made over the last decades. However, one of the main limitations of the state-of-the-art counting hybrid pixel detectors is the maximum count-rate that is very often few orders of magnitudes lower than of the incident, reflected or diffracted beam flux. Therefore, direct beam attenuation is mandatory in order to perform the measurements according to the detector's characteristics. In this work we present a major upgrade of a fast attenuation system developed at Synchrotron SOLEIL, which allows for a dynamical change of the beam attenuation as a function of the photon flux received by XPAD S140 photon counting detector. The system performs a cyclic real-time estimation of the flux received by every pixel during acquisition of an image and searches for clusters of at least two pixels that exceed user defined levels of counts/s. The beam attenuation is immediately and automatically changed in order to guarantee that the detector will always operate in its linear range even during a long continuous scan, by acting on the direct attenuators.}

To fulfil their powerful potential, electrodes with increased capacity, faster charge rates, and longer cycle life must be developed. Understanding the mechanics and chemistry of individual nanoparticles under in situ conditions is a crucial step to improving performance and mitigating damage. Here we reveal three-dimensional strain evolution within a single nanoparticle of a promising high voltage cathode material, LiNi<inf>0.5</inf>Mn<inf>1.5</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, under in situ conditions. The particle becomes disconnected during the second charging cycle. This is attributed to the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase layer with slow ionic conduction. The three-dimensional strain pattern within the particle is independent of cell voltage after disconnection, indicating that the particle is unable to redistribute lithium within its volume or to its neighbours. Understanding the disconnection process at the single particle level and the equilibrium or non-equilibrium state of nanoparticles is essential to improving performance of current and future electrochemical energy storage systems.},

Multimetallic nanomaterials serve as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts as a consequence of their unique physico-chemical properties. One method of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of multimetallic nanomaterials is to tune or control the surface strain of the nanomaterials, and tremendous progress has been made in this area in the past decade. In this Review, we summarize advances in the introduction, tuning and quantification of strain in multimetallic nanocrystals to achieve more efficient energy conversion by electrocatalysis. First, we introduce the concept of strain and its correlation with other key physico-chemical properties. Then, using the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen as a model reaction, we discuss the underlying mechanisms behind the strain-adsorption-reactivity relationship based on combined classical theories and models. We describe how this knowledge can be harnessed to design multimetallic nanocrystals with optimized strain to increase the efficiency of oxygen reduction. In particular, we highlight the unexpectedly beneficial (and previously overlooked) role of tensile strain from multimetallic nanocrystals in improving electrocatalysis. We conclude by outlining the challenges and offering our perspectives on the research directions in this burgeoning field.},

Here, we report high-lattice distortion at edges of Pt nanocrystals during heterogeneous catalytic methane oxidation based on in situ 3D Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. We directly observe contraction at edges owing to adsorption of oxygen. This strain increases during methane oxidation and it returns to the original state after completing the reaction process. The results are in good agreement with finite element models that incorporate forces, as determined by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Reaction mechanisms obtained from in situ strain imaging thus provide important insights for improving catalysts and designing future nanostructured catalytic materials.},

We report the facet-resolved, surface strain state of a single PtRh alloy nanoparticle on SrTiO$_3$ determined by coherent x-ray diffraction imaging under catalytic reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations allow us to correlate the facet surface strain state to its reaction environment–dependent chemical composition. We find that the initially Pt-terminated nanoparticle surface gets Rh-enriched under CO oxidation reaction conditions. The local composition is facet orientation dependent, and the Rh enrichment is nonreversible under subsequent CO reduction. Tracking facet-resolved strain and composition under operando conditions is crucial for a rational design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts with tailored activity, selectivity, and lifetime.}

Here, we exploit a pole figure approach to determine the three-dimensional orientation matrix of a nanostructure from a single Bragg reflection measured with a coherent nano-focused X-ray beam. The signature of any truncated (faceted) crystal produces a crystal truncation rod, which corresponds to a streak of intensity in reciprocal space normal to the surface. When two or more non-parallel facets are present, both the crystal orientation and the crystal facets can be identified. This enables facets to be rapidly indexed and uncommon facets, and planar defects, that have been difficult to study before to be identified. We demonstrate the technique with (i) epitaxial core-shell InGaN/GaN multiple quantum-wells grown on GaN nanowires, where surface facets and planar defects are determined, and (ii) single randomly oriented highly faceted tetrahedrahexal Pt nanoparticles.

However, BCDI relies on both dataset collection and phase retrieval algorithms that can induce artefacts in the reconstruction. Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the FFT. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in BCDI, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique. It concludes with the optimization of experimental parameters to improve throughput and to establish BCDI as a reliable 3D nano-imaging technique.},

   abstract = {The effects of dynamical diffraction in single crystals engender many unique diffraction phenomena that cannot be interpreted by the kinematical-diffraction theory, yet knowledge of them is vital to resolving a vast variety of scientific problems ranging from crystal optics to strain measurements in crystalline specimens. Although the fundamental dynamical-diffraction theory was established decades ago, modeling it remains a challenge in a general case wherein the crystal has complex boundaries and mixed diffraction geometries (Bragg or Laue). Here, we propose a universal approach for modeling x-ray dynamical diffraction from a single crystal with arbitrary shape and strain field that is based on the integral representation of the Takagi-Taupin equations. Using it, we can construct the solution iteratively via a converging series, independent of the diffraction geometry. Moreover, the integral equations offer additional insights into the diffraction physics that are not readily apparent in its differential counterparts. To demonstrate this approach, we studied the dynamical diffraction from a slab of single crystal with both Bragg and Laue diffraction excited on the entrance boundaries, a problem that is difficult to model by other methods. We also explored the mirage effect caused by the presence of a linear strain field and compared it to the Eikonal theory. Lastly, we derived a dynamical-diffraction equation correlating the structural properties of a particle to its far-field Bragg-diffraction pattern, shedding light on how dynamical diffraction affects these kinematical-diffraction-based inverse techniques for reconstructing the shape and the strain field. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

Probing the three-dimensional (3D) lattice strains that govern their interactions remains a challenge. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) allows strain to be measured with nanoscale 3D resolution. However, it is currently limited to materials that form microcrystals. Here we introduce a technique that allows the manufacture of BCDI samples from bulk materials. Using tungsten as an example, we show that focused ion-beam machining can be used to extract, from macroscopic crystals, micron-sized BCDI samples containing specific preselected defects. To interpret the experimental data, we develop a displacement-gradient-based analysis for multireflection BCDI. This allows accurate recovery of the full lattice strain tensor from samples containing multiple dislocations. These capabilities open the door to BCDI as a microscopy tool for studying complex real-world materials.},

Typical phase retrieval algorithms are iterative in nature, and hence, are time-consuming and computationally expensive, making real-time imaging a challenge. Furthermore, iterative phase retrieval algorithms struggle to converge to the correct solution especially in the presence of strong phase structures. In this work, we demonstrate the training and testing of CDI NN, a pair of deep deconvolutional networks trained to predict structure and phase in real space of a 2D object from its corresponding far-field diffraction intensities alone. Once trained, CDI NN can invert a diffraction pattern to an image within a few milliseconds of compute time on a standard desktop machine, opening the door to real-time imaging.},

Despite meeting all the oversampling requirements of Sayre and Shannon, current phase retrieval approaches still have trouble achieving a unique inversion of experimental data in the presence of noise. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation by incorporating a 3D Machine Learning (ML) model combining (optional) supervised learning with transfer learning. The trained ML model can rapidly provide an immediate result with high accuracy which could benefit real-time experiments, and the predicted result can be further refined with transfer learning. More significantly, the proposed ML model can be used without any prior training to learn the missing phases of an image based on minimization of an appropriate `loss function' alone. We demonstrate significantly improved performance with experimental Bragg CDI data over traditional iterative phase retrieval algorithms.},

We test the descriptor with four different adsorbates on four active sites of two metals, and applying strain in the range of ±3\%, usually observed experimentally at catalytic metal surfaces. Furthermore, we use the descriptor to illustrate catalyst design availing strain and nearest-neighbor effects simultaneously for the oxygen reduction reaction, a reaction of high importance in fuel cells.

Because adsorption energies are the most common descriptors, electrocatalyst design is largely based on brute-force routines that comb materials databases until an energetic criterion is verified. In this review, it is shown that an alternative is provided by generalized coordination numbers (denoted by CN¯\$\overline {{\rm{CN}}} \$ or GCN), an inexpensive geometric descriptor for strained and unstrained transition metals and some alloys. CN¯\$\overline {{\rm{CN}}} \$ captures trends in adsorption energies on both extended surfaces and nanoparticles and is used to elaborate structure-sensitive electrocatalytic activity plots and selectivity maps.

As Pt nanoparticles are normally used to maximize catalyst utilization and to minimize catalyst loading, it is important to rationalize and predict catalytic activity trends in nanoparticles in simple terms, while being able to compare these trends with those of extended surfaces. The trends in the adsorption energies of small oxygen- and hydrogen-containing adsorbates on Pt nanoparticles of various sizes and on extended surfaces were analyzed through DFT calculations by making use of the generalized coordination numbers of the surface sites. This simple and predictive descriptor links the geometric arrangement of a surface to its adsorption properties. It generates linear adsorption-energy trends, captures finite-size effects, and provides more accurate descriptions than d-band centers and usual coordination numbers. Unlike electronic-structure descriptors, which require knowledge of the densities of states, it is calculated manually. Finally, it was shown that an approximate equivalence exists between generalized coordination numbers and d-band centers.},

Metals constitute a wide class of catalysts, and because catalysis occurs on the surface, there is an economic incentive, especially for precious metals, to obtain catalysts in the form of small metal particles. This, however, raises two main problems. One is fundamental in nature and addresses the question as to below which particle size the metallic properties are lost. The other is more practical and concerns the preparation and characterization of very small particles and their catalytic activity. The other problem concerns the practical ways of producing metals with particle sizes around the critical value calculated above. The easiest and most practical way to achieve this goal is to deposit the metal in low concentration on a high-surface-area support. The main purpose of using a carrier is, of course, to achieve a high dispersion of the metal and to stabilize it against sintering. In a number of reactions, however, the metal support is not inert and the overall process is actually a combination of two functions: that of the metal and that of the catalytically active support.}

abstract={An overview of recent advancements in density functional theory modeling of particularly reactive sites at noble and late transition metal surfaces is given. Such special sites include sites at the flat surfaces of thin metal films, sites at stepped surfaces, sites at the metal/oxide interface boundary for oxide-supported metal clusters, and sites at the perimeter of oxide islands grown on metal surfaces. The Newns--Anderson model of the electronic interaction underlying chemisorption is described. This provides the grounds for introducing the Hammer--N{\o}rskov d-band model that correlates changes in the energy center of the valence d-band density of states at the surface sites with their ability to form chemisorption bonds. A reactivity change described by this model is characterized as an electronic structure effect. Br{\o}nsted plots of energy barriers versus reaction energies are discussed from the surface reaction perspective and are used to analyze the trends in the calculated changes. Deviations in the relation between energy barriers and reaction energies in Br{\o}nsted plots are identified as due to atomic structure effects. The reactivity change from pure Pd surfaces to Pd thin films supported on MgO can be assigned to an electronic effect. Likewise for the reactivity change from flat Au surfaces, over Au thin films to Au edges and the Au/MgO interface boundary. The reactivity enhancement at atomic step sites is of both electronic and atomic structure nature for NO dissociation at Ru, Rh and Pd surfaces. The enhancement of the CO oxidation reactivity when moving from a CO+O coadsorption structure on Pt(111) to the PtO$_2$ oxide island edges supported by Pt(111) is, however, identified as mainly an atomic structure effect. As such, it is linked to the occurrence of favorable pathways at the oxide island edges and is occurring despite of stronger adsorbate binding of the oxygen within the oxide edge, i.e. despite of an opposing electronic effect. As a final topic, a discussion is given of the accuracy of density functional theory in conjunction with surface reactions; adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and dissociation. Energy barriers are concluded to be more robust with respect to changes in the exchange-correlation functional than are molecular bond and adsorption energies.},

The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however---gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals. To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H$_2$ on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table. We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold.},

Catalytic oxidation has appeared as an innovative and promising approach, as the pollutants can be totally oxidized at moderate operating temperatures under 500 &deg;C. The most active single oxides in the total oxidation of hydrocarbons have been shown to be manganese and cobalt oxides. The main factors affecting the catalytic performances of several metal-oxide catalysts, including CoOx and MnOx, in relation to the total oxidation of hydrocarbons have been reviewed. The influence of these factors is directly related to the Mars - van Krevelen mechanism, which is known to be applied in the case of the oxidation of VOCs in general and hydrocarbons in particular, using transitional metal oxides as catalysts. The catalytic behaviors of the studied oxides could be closely related to their redox properties, their nonstoichiometric, defective structure, and their lattice oxygen mobility. The control of the structural and textural properties of the studied metal oxides, such as specific surface area and specific morphology, plays an important role in catalytic applications. A fundamental challenge in the development of efficient and low-cost catalysts is to choose the criteria for selecting them. Therefore, this research could be useful for tailoring advanced and high-performance catalysts for the total oxidation of VOCs.},

abstract = {Multi-wavelength (mw) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) is demonstrated on a single Au particle. The multi-wavelength Bragg diffraction patterns are inverted using conventional phase-retrieval algorithms where the dilation of the effective pixel size of a pixelated 2D detector caused by the variation of the X-ray beam energy is mitigated by interpolating the raw data. The reconstructed Bragg electron density and phase field are in excellent agreement with the results obtained from conventional rocking scans of the same particle. Voxel sizes of about 63nm3 are obtained for reconstructions from both approaches. Phase shifts as small as 0.41rad, which correspond to displacements of 14pm and translate into strain resolution better than 10-4 in the Au particle, are resolved. The displacement field changes shape during the experiment, which is well reproduced by finite element method simulations considering an inhomogeneous strained carbon layer deposited on the Au particle over the course of the measurements. These experiments thus demonstrate the very high sensitivity of BCDI and mw-BCDI to strain induced by contaminations. Furthermore, mw-BCDI offers new opportunities for in situ and operando 3D strain imaging in complex sample environments.},

abstract = {Nanoscale structures can be highly strained because of confinement effects and the strong influence of their external boundaries. This results in dramatically different electronic, magnetic and optical material properties of considerable utility. Third-generation synchrotron-based coherent X-ray diffraction has emerged as a non-destructive tool for three-dimensional(3D) imaging of strain and defects in crystals that are smaller than the coherence volume, typically a few cubic micrometres, of the available beams that have sufficient flux to reveal the materials structure1. Until now, measurements have been possible only at a single Bragg point of a given crystal beause of the limited ability to maintain alignment2; it has therefore been possible to determine only one component of displacement and not the full strain tensor. Here we report key advances in our fabrication and experimental techniques, which have enabled diffraction patterns to be obtained from six Bragg reflections of the same ZnO nanocrystal for the first time. All three Cartesian components of the ion displacement field, and in turn the full nine-component strain tensor, have thereby been imaged in three dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI), a technique where an object is reconstructed from a single (2D or 3D) diffraction pattern, recovers the lost diffraction phases without a priori knowledge of the extent (support) of the object. The uncertainty of the object support can lead to over-fitting and prevents an unambiguous metric evaluation of solutions. We propose to use a 'free' log-likelihood indicator, where a small percentage of points are masked from the reconstruction algorithms, as an unbiased metric to evaluate the validity of computed solutions, independent of the sample studied. We also show how a set of solutions can be analysed through an eigen-decomposition to yield a better estimate of the real object. Example analysis on experimental data is presented both for a test pattern dataset, and the diffraction pattern from a live cyanobacteria cell. The method allows the validation of reconstructions on a wide range of materials (hard condensed or biological), and should be particularly relevant for 4th generation synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, where large, high-throughput datasets require a method for unsupervised data evaluation.},

It relies on numerically retrieving the phase of the scattering amplitude from a crystal illuminated with coherent X-rays. In practice, the algorithms encode this amplitude as a discrete Fourier transform of an effective or Bragg electron density. This short article suggests a detailed route from the classical expression of the (continuous) scattering amplitude to this discrete function. The case of a heterogeneous incident field is specifically detailed. Six assumptions are listed and quantitatively discussed when no such analysis was found in the literature. Details are provided for two of them: the fact that the structure factor varies in the vicinity of the probed reciprocal lattice vector, and the polarization factor, which is heterogeneous along the measured diffraction patterns. With progress in X-ray sources, data acquisition and analysis, it is believed that some approximations will prove inappropriate in the near future.},

The Auger electron spectra of gas-phase ammonia{,} pure ammonia clusters and ammonia in aqueous solution are compared and interpreted via ab initio calculations of the Auger spectrum of the ammonia monomer and dimer.

Features at energies pertaining to delocalized states involving one{,} or more{,} hydrogen bonding orbitals can be found in both the ammonia cluster Auger electron spectrum and in that of the liquid solvated molecule. The lower Coulombic repulsion between two delocalized valence final state holes gives higher kinetic energy of the Auger electrons which is also observed in the spectra.

abstract = {We utilized temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to study the chemisorption of gas-phase oxygen atoms on Pt(100)-hex-R0.7° at 450K and 573K, and find that the types and relative populations of oxygen phases that develop are highly dependent on the surface temperature during adsorption. At both temperatures, oxygen atoms initially adsorb on defects associated with the surface reconstruction. Increasing the coverage to about 0.32ML (monolayers) at 573K causes deconstruction and population of a phase with apparent (3×1) symmetry that desorbs in a single feature centered at about 672K. Saturating at 0.63ML leads to the formation of an additional “complex” ordered phase that desorbs in a sharp feature exhibiting autocatalytic behavior as it shifts from approximately 631K to 642K. Uptake at 450K also initiates deconstruction, but in this case two desorption maxima at about 652K and 672K grow simultaneously with increasing coverage to about 0.32ML. The feature at 672K is associated with the disordered (3×1) phase, while the feature at 652K has not been previously reported. We attribute this new feature to desorption from disordered arrangements of high oxygen concentrations on (1×1) surface regions. As the coverage increases to about 0.51ML, small amounts of the complex phase grow, while this “high-concentration” (1×1) and the (3×1) phases continue to develop. We conclude that the complex phase is energetically preferred over the high-concentration (1×1) phase, but kinetic barriers hinder its formation at 450K, causing oxygen to become trapped in the high-concentration (1×1) phase. Therefore, the high-concentration (1×1) phase is metastable relative to the complex phase. Lastly, above about 0.51ML, further adsorption at 450K promotes the growth of Pt oxide islands as detailed in a future investigation.}

The anion and Bi adsorption behaviours suggest that the {111}Pt nanoparticles contain relatively wide hexagonal domains and also isolated sites which could adsorb solely hydrogen. Bi step decoration has been successfully extended to modify the defects of {111}Pt nanoparticles without blocking terrace sites. CO charge displacement has been applied to determine the potential of zero total charge (pztc) of non-decorated and Bi decorated surfaces. It has found that the positive shift of pztc on defect-decorated {111}Pt nanoparticles is not so significant in comparison with that of Pt(554) due to the relative short mean length of (111) domains on the {111}Pt nanoparticles. CO stripping demonstrates that {111}Pt nanoparticles exhibit higher reactivity toward CO oxidation. This reflects the role of the defect sites in nanoparticles{,} evidenced by the disappearance of the “pre-wave” in the stripping voltammogram once the defects were blocked by Bi. The stripping peaks shift to higher potential on Bi decorated surfaces{,} indicating the active role of both steps and defects for CO oxidation. By comparing the CO stripping charge and the change in hydrogen adsorption charge of surfaces with and without Bi decoration{,} including reasonable deconvolution{,} the local CO coverage on defect and terrace sites were obtained for the first time for the {111}Pt nanoparticles{,} and the results are in good agreement with those obtained on Pt(554). Chronoamperometry studies show tailing in all current–time transients of CO oxidation on all surfaces studied. The kinetics of CO oxidation can be satisfactorily simulated by a modified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model{,} demonstrating that CO oxidation on all studied surfaces follows the same mechanism."

Nanostructuring active particles can yield faster charging/discharging kinetics, increased lifespan and record catalytic activities. However, establishing the causal link between structure and function is challenging for nanoparticles, as ensemble measurements convolve intrinsic single-particle properties with sample diversity. Here we study the hydriding phase transformation in individual palladium nanocubes in situ using coherent X-ray diffractive imaging. The phase transformation dynamics, which involve the nucleation and propagation of a hydrogen-rich region, are dependent on absolute time (aging) and involve intermittent dynamics (avalanching). A hydrogen-rich surface layer dominates the crystal strain in the hydrogen-poor phase, while strain inversion occurs at the cube corners in the hydrogen-rich phase. A three-dimensional phase-field model is used to interpret the experimental results. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a general framework for designing and optimizing phase transformations for single nanocrystals in reactive environments.},

abstract={Atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations have been increasing since the industrial revolution and currently account for 6{\%} of total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Microbial production in soils is the dominant nitrous oxide source; this has increased with increasing use of nitrogen fertilizers. However, fertilizer use alone cannot account for the historical trends of atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide. Here, I analyse atmospheric concentrations, industrial sources of nitrous oxide, and fertilizer and manure production since 1860. Before 1960, agricultural expansion, including livestock production, may have caused globally significant mining of soil nitrogen, fuelling a steady increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide. After 1960, the rate of the increase rose, due to accelerating use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Using a regression model, I show that 2.0{\%} of manure nitrogen and 2.5{\%} of fertilizer nitrogen was converted to nitrous oxide between 1860 and 2005; these percentage contributions explain the entire pattern of increasing nitrous oxide concentrations over this period. Consideration of processes that re-concentrate soil nitrogen, such as manure production by livestock, improved `hind-casting' of nitrous oxide emissions. As animal protein consumption in human diets increases globally, management of manure will be an important component of future efforts to reduce anthropogenic nitrous oxide sources.},

abstract  ="Corrosion is a major concern for many industries{,} as corrosive environments can induce structural and morphological changes that lead to material dissolution and accelerate material failure. The progression of corrosion depends on nanoscale morphology{,} stress{,} and defects present. Experimentally monitoring this complex interplay is challenging. Here we implement in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) to probe the dissolution of a Co–Fe alloy microcrystal exposed to hydrochloric acid (HCl). By measuring five Bragg reflections from a single isolated microcrystal at ambient conditions{,} we compare the full three-dimensional (3D) strain state before corrosion and the strain along the [111] direction throughout the corrosion process. We find that the strained surface layer of the crystal dissolves to leave a progressively less strained surface. Interestingly{,} the average strain closer to the centre of the crystal increases during the corrosion process. We determine the localised corrosion rate from BCDI data{,} revealing the preferential dissolution of facets more exposed to the acid stream{,} highlighting an experimental geometry effect. These results bring new perspectives to understanding the interplay between crystal strain{,} morphology{,} and corrosion; a prerequisite for the design of more corrosion-resistant materials."

One of CDI's important applications is to probe dynamic phenomena with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we report the development of a general in situ CDI method for real-time imaging of dynamic processes in solution. By introducing a time-invariant overlapping region as real-space constraint, we simultaneously reconstructed a time series of complex exit wave of dynamic processes with robust and fast convergence. We validated this method using optical laser experiments and numerical simulations with coherent X-rays. Our numerical simulations further indicated that in situ CDI can potentially reduce radiation dose by more than an order of magnitude relative to conventional CDI. With further development, we envision in situ CDI could be applied to probe a range of dynamic phenomena in the future.},

Albeit with various advantages of CDI based on synchrotrons and newly developed x-ray free electron lasers, its applications would be limited without improving resolution well below 10 nm. Here, we review the issues and efforts in improving CDI resolution including various methods for resolution determination. Enhancing diffraction signal at large diffraction angles, with the aid of interference between neighboring strong scatterers or templates, is reviewed and discussed in terms of increasing signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we discuss errors in image reconstruction algorithms—caused by the discreteness of the Fourier transformations involved—which degrade the spatial resolution, and suggest ways to correct them. We expect this review to be useful for applications of CDI in imaging weakly scattering soft matters using coherent x-ray sources including x-ray free electron lasers.}

   abstract = {Direct inversion of coherent X-ray diffraction patterns is a powerful method to image strains in individual crystals with a high spatial resolution, less than 10 nm. The possibility to invert the diffraction pattern is in principle ensured by the oversampling of the measurement. In addition, the resolution of the reconstructed object requires the measurement of the intensity distribution as far as possible in reciprocal space. Thus, fulfilling the oversampling and resolution constraints, in 3D, implies very long acquisition times, hardly compatible with the stability of the X-ray synchrotron source or sample. To overcome this problem, we present a method based on partial crossed intensity measurements: it consists in two irregularly spaced intensity measurements taken in two orthogonal directions. This paper demonstrates that partial crossed intensity measurements are in principle sufficient to reconstruct 2D objects using a phase retrieval algorithm. We also describe how such measurements can be achieved in practice for 3D imaging. 3D intensity measurements taken in two orthogonal directions for a 111 Bragg peak of a sub-micrometer Au grain are shown.},

The reason for the sluggish development of selective chemisorption probes for oxides is that the same chemisorption probes that work well with metals aren’t compatible with oxides since these chemical probes weakly adsorb on oxides. Methanol, however, is a very reactive molecule that has been found to readily chemisorb on oxides and allows for quantitative determination of the number of active surface sites (Ns). In this mini-review, the determination of the number of active sites by methanol chemisorption is reviewed with examples for pure oxides (one-component oxides), supported oxides (submonolayer, monolayer and above monolayer) and bulk mixed oxides (surface enriched oxide present in submonolayer, monolayer and in excess of monolayer coverages).}

The characteristic feature of this mechanism is that some products of the reaction leave the solid catalysts’ surface with one or more constituents of the catalysts’ lattice. First in this review, the position of this mechanism amongst other ways of catalytic activation will be defined. Then, the experimental evidence for this mechanism will be presented. Some less common reactions running with this mechanism will be discussed in more detail, among them the deoxygenation of nitrocompounds and carboxylic acids. The participation of the lattice components (O, S, Cl, H) in the formation of products leads to a relation of the catalytic activity with the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the catalysts lattice.

This chapter focuses on scientific aspects of etching, and demonstrates that etching is technologically significant. Rapid metal (or semiconductor) etching involving loss of material is encountered in several areas of technology and science. Similar mechanisms account successfully for these processes. Vapor phase free radicals interact with the solid surface to form surface complexes that are subsequently volatilized. This process leads to net loss of material from the solid and often to gross surface reconstruction as well. There are subtle, but important, differences among the etching processes. In the case of catalytic etching, the surface species formed by free-radical/metal interactions spontaneously volatilize. In contrast, in plasma etching, high-energy charged species often play a synergistic role. In some cases they provide the energy required for volatilization. In other cases they provide the energy required for reactions between free radicals and surface atoms, and the surface complexes thus formed volatilize spontaneously.}

abstract = {Changes in the morphology of catalysts during their preparation and use are probably important to the stability of most catalyst systems, but, in spite of extensive investigations of these phenomena, the rates of these changes and the structures formed are typically characterized only qualitatively and no consensus exists as to the mechanisms of morphology changes. In this paper experiments on the morphology of macroscopic unsupported metal catalysts in unreactive gases (thermal etching) and in reactive gases (catalytic etching) are reviewed, and a number of mechanisms which may be responsible for etching are summarized. In both thermal and catalytic etching a variety of structures such as faceting to form specific crystal planes, grooving of grain boundaries, pit and hillock formation, undercutting, and crystallite growth are observed. All studies indicate strong dependences of morphological features and etching rates on temperature, pressure, gas composition, impurities, flow velocities, and time. Most studies have been for exothermic reactions on Group VIII transition metals, but even for similar reactions and similar metals, correlations are frequently elusive. Morphology changes have frequently been interpreted through equilibrium considerations, the driving force assumed to be the reduction in surface free energy which accompanies faceting. The mechanisms of mass transport in many systems are probably capillarity—induced surface and volume diffusion and evaporation-condensation processes. These considerations may be adequate to explain simple morphological features especially in thermal etching under certain simplified conditions. Additional complexities arise in catalytic etching, where the superposition of chemical reactions onto a process driven by capillarity can significantly alter mass transport. Moreover, the undercutting and crystallite growths, which occur when catalyst material is being continuously lost (e.g. in the form of volatile compounds), produces nonequilibrium processes requiring a detailed specification of the boundary layer at the catalyst surface.}

abstract = {The etching which occurs when platinum is heated in NH$_3$-air mixtures has been studied by exposing high purity wires to gases at different compositions and temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy indicates that etching is much more extensive and rapid in mixtures than in either pure O$_2$ or pure NH$_3$. Depending on the composition and temperature, etching produces either flat facets, curved surfaces, pitting, or a combination of several modes. A “phase diagram” for catalytic etching is constructed from micrographs of ~80 specimens. The structures are similar to those observed when metals are heated in oxygen, but they develop in much shorter times and at lower temperatures. Crystallographic variations in surface tension and volatile oxide formation appear to be inadequate to explain these observations. A mechanism for catalytic etching which includes effects of both the surface reaction and the gas-phase boundary layer is proposed. Volatile oxide transport could be the transport mechanism under O$_2$-rich operation but surface diffusion is probably dominant in the NH$_3$-rich regime. Pit formation appears to be associated with preferential attack at line defects for certain temperatures and compositions.}

Nitrogen and nitrous oxide were the only nitrogen-containing products with about four times as much nitrogen as nitrous oxide. The initial specific catalytic activity of the large crystallite catalyst was higher than the 2.0 and 2.7 nm catalyst by factors of 5.7 and 3.7, respectively. All catalysts showed a marked decline in activity in the first 6 hr of operation with steady-state activity being reached in about 12 hr. Smaller crystallites were more severely deactivated so that the resultant steady-state specific activity of the large crystallite catalyst was greater by factors of 14 and 8. Both the specific catalytic activity and the selectivity, also a function of crystallite size, are explained in terms of the changes in average surface concentration of active oxygen with changes in crystallite size. The reaction rate data are best represented by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model involving dissociative adsorption of both reactants.}

The results were compared with those obtained over the industrially applied Pt95–Rh5 alloy. Analysis of characteristic times of the transient responses of N$_2$ and NO made it possible to gain insight into the sequence of their formation. A common feature of both metal oxide and noble metal catalysts is that NO is a primary product of NH$_3$ oxidation, whereas N$_2$ results mainly from secondary transformations of NO. The amount of N$_2$O formed over the oxides was minimal. Multipulse NH$_3$ experiments in the absence of gas-phase O$_2$ give unequivocal evidence of the participation of surface lattice oxygen of the metal oxides in the reaction of NH$_3$ to NO. The degree of reduction of the oxide surface determines the product distribution but does not alter the catalytic activity for NH$_3$ conversion. Greater reduction favors the reaction channel to N$_2$ over that to NO. The desired reaction follows a Mars–van Krevelen-type scheme involving the participation of lattice oxygen in the NH$_3$ conversion to NO and regeneration of the so-formed vacancies by gas-phase O$_2$ and bulk lattice oxygen. Replenishment of surface vacancies by the diffusion of bulk oxygen occurs to a significant extent over Fe2O3. However, when NH$_3$ and O$_2$ are fed together, dissociative adsorption of gas-phase oxygen can be considered the main mechanism for vacancy regeneration.}

The unique features of the TAP technique enable investigation of the mechanism of this highly exothermic process under isothermal conditions over catalysts of industrial relevance, and the applicaton of much higher peak pressures as compared to surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum. This article focuses on the investigation of primary interactions of NH$_3$ and O$_2$. The overall reaction mechanism was found to be very similar over both Pt and Pt–Rh gauzes. NH$_3$ activation is favored over O$_2$-pretreated gauzes, while the as-received gauzes are virtually inactive for NH$_3$ decomposition to N$_2$. The selectivity to NO primarily depends on the concentration of adsorbed oxygen species. A high ratio of adsorbed O/NHx species favors NO formation, confirming that undesirable secondary reaction paths are minimized at a high O coverage. Besides, our results suggest that the nature of oxygen species influences the distribution of NO and N$_2$ in the product. It is put forward that weakly bounded oxygen species lead to a high NO selectivity, while strongly bounded oxidize NH$_3$ into N$_2$. The interaction of NH$_3$ and NO also contributes to N$_2$ formation, while direct NO decomposition is practically suppressed over the oxidized gauzes. Application of isotopically labeled 15 NH$_3$ and high peak pressures were essential for detecting N$_2$O formation during ammonia oxidation. Analysis of secondary interactions of NH$_3$ and NO in the authors' next project is required to further unravel the origins of reaction by-products like N$_2$O and N$_2$.}

Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction (including isotopic substitution), x-ray diffraction (including anomalous scattering) and electron diffraction, extended x-ray absorption fine structure and nuclear magnetic resonance (magic angle spinning and second moment) have already been used to provide data. RMC modelling can also be applied to many different types of system - liquids, glasses, polymers, crystals and magnetic materials. This article outlines the RMC method and discusses some of the common misconceptions about it. It is stressed that RMC models are neither unique nor `correct'. However, they are often useful for aiding our understanding either of the structure itself, or of the relationships between local structure and other physical properties. Examples are given and the possibilities for further development of the RMC method are discussed.}

@article{Boulle2019,
abstract = {The Python programming language, combined with the numerical computing library NumPy and the scientific computing library SciPy, has become the de facto standard for scientific computing in a variety of fields. This popularity is mainly due to the ease with which a Python program can be written and executed (easy syntax, dynamical typing, no compilation etc.), coupled with the existence of a large number of specialized third-party libraries that aim to lift all the limitations of the raw Python language. NumPy introduces vector programming, improving execution speeds, whereas SciPy brings a wealth of highly optimized and reliable scientific functions. There are cases, however, where vector programming alone is not sufficient to reach optimal performance. This issue is addressed with dedicated compilers that aim to translate Python code into native and statically typed code with support for the multi-core architectures of modern processors. In the present article it is shown how these approaches can be efficiently used to tackle different problems, with increasing complexity, that are relevant to crystallography: the 2D Laue function, scattering from a strained 2D crystal, scattering from 3D nanocrystals and, finally, diffraction from films and multilayers. For each case, detailed implementations and explanations of the functioning of the algorithms are provided. Different Python compilers (namely NumExpr, Numba, Pythran and Cython) are used to improve performance and are benchmarked against state-of-the-art NumPy implementations. All examples are also provided as commented and didactic Python (Jupyter) notebooks that can be used as starting points for crystallographers curious to enter the Python ecosystem or wishing to accelerate their existing codes.},

Although ideal planar IDBs are well documented, the understanding of their conﬁgurations and interactions inside crystals relies on perfect-interface assumptions. Here, we report on the microscopic conﬁguration of IDBs inside n-doped gallium nitride wires revealed by coherent X-ray Bragg imaging. Complex IDB conﬁgurations are evidenced with 6 nm resolution and the absolute polarity of each domain is unambiguously identiﬁed. Picoscale displacements along and across the wire are directly extracted from several Bragg reﬂections using phase retrieval algorithms, revealing rigid relative displacements of the domains and the absence of microscopic strain away from the IDBs. More generally, this method offers an accurate inner view of the displacements and strain of interacting defects inside small crystals that may alter optoelectronic properties of semiconductor devices.},

However, nanoscale to microscale variations in structure, composition, and strain within a given nanowire, as well as variations between nanowires, pose challenges to correlating microstructure with device performance. In this work, we utilize coherent nanofocused X-rays to characterize stacking defects and strain in a single InGaAs nanowire supported on Si. By reconstructing diffraction patterns from the 21̅1̅0 Bragg peak, we show that the lattice orientation varies along the length of the wire, while the strain field along the cross-section is largely unaffected, leaving the band structure unperturbed. Diffraction patterns from the 011̅0 Bragg peak are reproducibly reconstructed to create three-dimensional images of stacking defects and associated lattice strains, revealing sharp planar boundaries between different crystal phases of wurtzite (WZ) structure that contribute to charge carrier scattering. Phase retrieval is made possible by developing multiangle Bragg projection ptychography (maBPP) to accommodate coherent nanodiffraction patterns measured at arbitrary overlapping positions at multiple angles about a Bragg peak, eliminating the need for scan registration at different angles. The penetrating nature of X-ray radiation, together with the relaxed constraints of maBPP, will enable the in operando imaging of nanowire devices.},

Diminished coherence results in reconstructions that suffer from artefacts or fail completely. Here we demonstrate ab initio phasing of partially coherent diffraction patterns in three dimensions, while simultaneously determining the coherence properties of the illuminating wavefield. Both the dramatic improvements in image interpretability and the three-dimensional evaluation of the coherence will have broad implications for quantitative imaging of nanostructures and wavefield characterization with X-rays and electrons.},

ABSTRACT = {The simultaneous measurement of two Bragg reflections by Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction is demonstrated on a twinned Au crystal, which was prepared by the solid-state dewetting of a 30 nm thin gold film on a sapphire substrate. The crystal was oriented on a goniometer so that two lattice planes fulfill the Bragg condition at the same time. The Au 111 and Au 200 Bragg peaks were measured simultaneously by scanning the energy of the incident X-ray beam and recording the diffraction patterns with two two-dimensional detectors. While the former Bragg reflection is not sensitive to the twin boundary, which is oriented parallel to the crystal–substrate interface, the latter reflection is only sensitive to one part of the crystal. The volume ratio between the two parts of the twinned crystal is about 1:9, which is also confirmed by Laue microdiffraction of the same crystal. The parallel measurement of multiple Bragg reflections is essential for future in situ and operando studies, which are so far limited to either a single Bragg reflection or several in series, to facilitate the precise monitoring of both the strain field and defects during the application of external stimuli.},

   abstract = {The rapid development of synchrotrons has massively increased the speed at which experiments can be performed, while new techniques have increased the amount of raw data collected during each experiment. While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time- and money-expensive synchrotron beam-time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine-tuning of beam-time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the “data deluge,” affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries.},

The same line shape should also occur for the discrete line spectra of X-rays emitted from metals. This mechanism could account for the well-known asymmetries observed for K alpha lines.}

By the use of in situ surface x-ray diffraction under realistic CO oxidation reaction conditions, we show that the onset of the growth of thin RhO2 oxide film coincides with an increase in CO2  production. During the reaction, the consumed oxide film is continuously re-grown by oxygen in the gas phase. Our theoretical results strongly suggest that the CO adsorbs on the metallic substrate but reacts with the O in the RhO2 oxide film at the border between the RhO2  oxide film and the metallic substrate. This scenario could explain the experimental observations of oxidation reactions on other late transition metal surfaces as well as on their corresponding nanoparticles under realistic conditions.}

These images are retrieved from the three-dimensional diffraction data using no a priori knowledge about the shape or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial resolution).

Our computer phasing experiments accurately retrieved the phase from the magnitude of the Fourier transforms of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects by using positivity constraints on the imaginary part of the objects and loose supports, with the oversampling factor much less than 4 for 2D and 8 for 3D objects.

abstract = {The activity of iridium and platinum sponge catalysts was studied in the low temperature gas phase oxidation of ammonia with oxygen. Under the reaction conditions used, iridium was found to be more active and more selective to nitrogen than platinum. Furthermore it was established from activity measurements that both catalysts lose activity as a function of time on stream due to inhibition of the surface by reaction intermediates. The used catalysts were studied with XPS and temperature programmed techniques. It was found that the surface of the catalysts had a high coverage of NH and OH and some additional NH2. It seems most likely that the reaction mechanism proceeds through a stepwise dehydrogenation of the ammonia molecule. It appears that the last dehydrogenation step (NH by OH to N and water) is the rate determining step. The high selectivity of iridium to nitrogen can be explained by the higher activity of iridium in dissociating NO.}

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.
Patients and methods
French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.
Results
Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
Conclusion
Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.}

In particular, by means of linear combination fit of the XANES spectra, the notebook determines the chemical species distribution in the sample under investigation. The direct output of the analysis process is the correlation between the different elemental distributions and the spatial localization of the chemical species detected.

The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion has now become the standard quality measure. However, what has continued to be controversial is the issue of the FSC threshold level at which one defines the reproducible resolution. Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of “voxels” in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like “0.5”) may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are—as we show here—simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the σ-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas σ-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

   abstract = {Electrocatalysis is at the heart of a broad range of physicochemical applications that play an important role in the present and future of a sustainable economy. Among the myriad of different electrocatalysts used in this field, nanomaterials are of ubiquitous importance. An increased surface area/volume ratio compared to bulk makes nanoscale catalysts the preferred choice to perform electrocatalytic reactions. Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was introduced in 2006 and since has been applied to obtain 3D images of crystalline nanomaterials. BCDI provides information about the displacement field, which is directly related to strain. Lattice strain in the catalysts impacts their electronic configuration and, consequently, their binding energy with reaction intermediates. Even though there have been significant improvements since its birth, the fact that the experiments can only be performed at synchrotron facilities and its relatively low resolution to date (∼10 nm spatial resolution) have prevented the popularization of this technique. Herein, we will briefly describe the fundamentals of the technique, including the electrocatalysis relevant information that we can extract from it. Subsequently, we review some of the computational experiments that complement the BCDI data for enhanced information extraction and improved understanding of the underlying nanoscale electrocatalytic processes. We next highlight success stories of BCDI applied to different electrochemical systems and in heterogeneous catalysis to show how the technique can contribute to future studies in electrocatalysis. Finally, we outline current challenges in spatiotemporal resolution limits of BCDI and provide our perspectives on recent developments in synchrotron facilities as well as the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in addressing them.},

abstract = {The dissociation of nitric oxide on a ruthenium(0001) surface was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. The distribution of nitrogen atoms after the dissociation allowed the identification of the "active sites" for this reaction, which are formed by the low-coordinated, top metal atoms of atomic steps. It is proposed that their activity is caused by local changes in the electronic structure. The structure of the steps determines whether they remain active or become deactivated by oxygen atoms. The results demonstrate the complex manner in which the structure of a catalytic surface determines the reactivity of the catalyst and confirm the active sites concept.}

abstract = {Defects can affect all aspects of a material by altering its electronic properties and controlling its chemical reactivity. At defect sites, preferential adsorption of reactants and/or formation of chemical species at active sites are observed in heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the structural response at defect sites during catalytic reactions provides a unique opportunity to exploit defect control of nanoparticle-based catalysts. However, it remains difficult to characterize the strain and defect evolution for a single nanocrystal catalyst in situ. Here, we report Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging of defect dynamics in an individual Pt nanoparticle during catalytic methane oxidation. We observed that the initially tensile strained regions of the crystal became seed points for the development of further strain and subsequent disappearance of diffraction density during oxidation reactions. Our detailed understanding of the catalytically induced deformation at the defect sites and observed reversibility during the relevant steps of the catalytic oxidation process provide important insights of defect control and engineering of heterogeneous catalysts.},

@article{Miao2000,
abstract = {Sampling the diffraction pattern of a finite specimen more finely than the Nyquist frequency (the inverse of the size of the diffracting specimen) corresponds to surrounding the electron density of the specimen with a no-density region. When the no-density region is bigger than the electron-density region, sufficient information is recorded so that the phase information can be retrieved from the oversampled diffraction pattern, at least in principle. By employing an iterative algorithm, the phase information from the oversampled diffraction pattern of a micrometre-sized test specimen has been successfully retrieved. This method is believed to be able to open a door for high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of complex and non-crystalline biological specimens, i.e. whole cells and sub-micrometre molecular clusters and micrometre-sized protein crystals. With the possible appearance in the future of X-ray free-electron lasers, it may become possible to image single molecules by recording diffraction patterns before radiation damage manifests itself.},

   abstract = {Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) milling is a mainstay of nano-scale machining. By manipulating a tightly focussed beam of energetic ions, often gallium (Ga+), FIB can sculpt nanostructures via localised sputtering. This ability to cut solid matter on the nano-scale revolutionised sample preparation across the life, earth and materials sciences. Despite its widespread usage, detailed understanding of the FIB-induced structural damage, intrinsic to the technique, remains elusive. Here we examine the defects caused by FIB in initially pristine objects. Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), we are able to spatially-resolve the full lattice strain tensor in FIB-milled gold nano-crystals. We find that every use of FIB causes large lattice distortions. Even very low ion doses, typical of FIB imaging and previously thought negligible, have a dramatic effect. Our results are consistent with a damage microstructure dominated by vacancies, highlighting the importance of free-surfaces in determining which defects are retained. At larger ion fluences, used during FIB-milling, we observe an extended dislocation network that causes stresses far beyond the bulk tensile strength of gold. These observations provide new fundamental insight into the nature of the damage created and the defects that lead to a surprisingly inhomogeneous morphology.},

We present robust algorithms for post-processing and alignment of these tomographic phase projections. A simple method to remove undesired constant and linear phase terms on the reconstructions is given. Also, we provide an algorithm for automatic alignment of projections that has good performance even for samples with no fiducial markers. Currently applied to phase projections, this alignment algorithm has proven to be robust and should also be useful for lens-based tomography techniques that pursue nanoscale 3D imaging. Lastly, we provide a method for tomographic reconstruction that works on phase projections that are known modulo 2π, such that the phase unwrapping step is avoided. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms by 3D imaging of bacteria population in legume root-nodule cells.},
