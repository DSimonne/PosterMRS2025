    \begin{alertblock}{Key takeaways}
        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{1em}
            \item Synchrotron radiation allows \textit{operando} studies.
            \item Strain signature is accessible \textit{via} Bragg imaging techniques.
            \item Combining techniques allows nano as well as meso scale information.
        \end{itemize}

        \heading{Multi-scale approach, sensitive to material density, crystal structure, and defects, during \textit{operando} studies.}
